     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>With the new critical hit mechanics, using Focus Energy on a Pokemon holding a Scope Lens causes every hit to be a critical hit; with Kingdra's Sniper ability, critical hits do 2.25x damage. Critical hits also bypass Draco Meteor's Special Attack drops and can break through defensive boosters. In this set, Draco Meteor is the main STAB move as it is powerful and it can be used indefinitely without repercussions. As a Water-type move, Hydro Pump in generally the best due to its power, but Surf can be used for the if Hydro Pump's poor accuracy is troubling, even though it is much weaker, especially before a boost. Finally, the last slot is dedicated to which Pokemon Kingdra want's to be able to muscle past. Agility is the main option here for when Kingdra can setup on a predicted switch, and then possibly setup on one move of the switch-in, allowing it to sweep a team with ease from that moment, though Hidden Power Fire can be used for Ferrothorn, an otherwise solid counter. This set can also run Outrage just so that Kingdra can 2HKO Chansey after a Focus Energy.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>A spread of 64 HP / 252 SpA / 192 Spe allows Kingdra to outspeed all unboosted Pokemon after an Agility, while giving it a bit of bulk to secure boosts and tank priority. However, an alternate EV spread of 80 HP / 252 SpA / 176 Spe can be used to outspeed Choice Scarf Garchomp if you are using Agility as well as fully investing in Special Attack, while slotting the rest of the EVs in HP to add a bit of bulk for ease in setting up. A Modest nature is the most preferable to increase power as this set uses mono-special coverage, but if one chooses to use Outrage, a Rash nature could be used instead.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Utilize Kingdra's ability to force switches to your advantage; this is to allow setup opportunities with Focus Energy or Agility. Focus Energy is the most beneficial setup move to use against defensive teams, as it allows Kingdra to hit massively hard against them, breaking through most defensive staples easily. Against faster, more offensive teams, Agility should be used to outspeed the opposing Pokemon, potentially leading to a sweep with Kingdra's STAB moves. Bear in mind that when using Agility, Kingdra will be affected by Draco Meteor's Special Attack drops, so it can't sweep as effectively against foes that resist Water. However, if you can manage to get up both boosts, Kingdra doesn't have to worry about any of the problems posed by only using one or the other. Kingdra's excellent typing allows it to switch in on Fire- and Water-type moves easily, which is especially helpful against Choice-locked attackers to allow setting up of either Focus Energy or Agility. Unlike most other sweepers, defensive boosters do not bother Kingdra, so this makes Kingdra an excellent way of breaking through these boosters if they start setting up, perfect for acting as a fail-safe.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Depending on which coverage move you use, this set has trouble with Ferrothorn or Azumarill, so partners that can take care of these threats for Kingdra are immensely appreciated. Heatran, Conkeldurr, and Talonflame can all deal with Ferrothorn, and Azumarill can easily be eliminated by Mega Venusaur, Manaphy, or Celebi. Scolipede is also a prime partner, as Kingdra's main flaw is its slightly sub-par Speed. Scolipede can Baton Pass Speed and Iron Defense boosts, a Substitute to ease Kingdra in setting up, and can even set up Spikes to help with Kingdra's sweep. In addition, it draws in Fire-type moves, which Kingdra can easily absorb thanks to its 4x resistance to them. Another way of remedying Kingdra's poor Speed is a Sticky Web inducer, such as Galvantula or Smeargle.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Ever since XY changed the critical hit mechanics, this has been Kingdra's new flagship set. While it lacks the Speed and sweeping capabilities of Kingdra's rain and Dragon Dance sets, it more than makes up for this with its wallbreaking ability. The reason for this is Focus Energy, the key move of this set. The reason for this is because after Kingdra sets Focus Energy up, its critical hit percentage combined with Scope Lens produces a guaranteed critical hit on every attack. This boost, in combination with Sniper, will make Draco Meteor an absolutely devastating attack, easily 2HKOing the likes of Umbreon and specially defensive Forretress. Waterfall is the best choice for a secondary STAB, as it can hit Florges on its lower Physical Defense. The last move is Agility, as a Pokemon this powerful has no need for coverage moves. So, if you ever get two turns to set up, a Focus Energy with an Agility can lead to an easy sweep if your opponent lacks a special wall.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>With the 1.5x boost it gives to critical hits, Sniper is the obvious choice for an ability here, as without it the set is much less functional and quite unviable. Alongside this boost, 252 EVs are put into Special Attack, to further boost the power of Draco Meteor. The rest are put into Speed, to Speed tie with neutral base 85s, such as opposing Critdra and Nidoking. And while a Naive nature would help with outrunning these threats, Rash is necessary, as that is what gives Draco Meteor and Waterfall that extra push that they need to finish off threats.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This Kingdra set places a lot of emphasis on proper prediction, because firing off a Draco Meteor into a Fairy-type and getting forced out is exactly what you don't want, as you just wasted two perfectly good turns. This is also true with Dragon resists, albeit less so because Kingdra 2HKOes most of them. Another thing you have to keep in mind when you use Critdra is that, even though you invested 252 EVs and the nature into SAtk, Kingdra still only has a base 95 Special Attack, meaning that Draco Meteors that are not critical hits will do fairly middling damage. Also, before Agility, Kingdra's base speed of 85 is outsped by many things, including every single Dragon-type in the tier.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>SubCM Jirachi is an excellent partner for Kingdra, as it can come in and get a free Substitute on the Fairy-types that Kingdra lures in. Other Steel-types such as Cobalion or Metagross can come in for free, and attempt to threaten the remainder of the opponent's team. Entry hazards are also a big help for something such as Kingdra, which gives it the extra help it needs to take down dedicated special walls such as Umbreon, Slowking or Florges. Therefore, Forretress and Froslass are good as they not only cover the Fairy weakness but also have the ability to lay down Spikes (and Stealth Rock in Forretress's case).</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Unlike the last two sets which were focused on hitting on the special side, this one is fully physical. The reason for this is Dragon Dance, a boosting move that not only buffs Kingdra's speed, but also its physical attack. If a Dragon Dance is able to be set up on the switch, Kingdra has the possibility to tear through the enemy team. STAB Waterfall after a Dragon Dance is a very powerful move, and it also has the added benefit of being able to flinch the opponent. Outrage is also a strong STAB move, with greater power at the cost of locking yourself in. The last move is a toss-up- Substitute is the most common choice, as it provides security and is a great move to use on a predicted switch. However, Iron Head is another very viable choice, as it 2HKOes Florges and also sports the good 30% flinch odds.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Leftovers are generally the best item for this set, as they not only recover off health lost from Substitutes, but they give much more survivability in general. However, Lum Berry is also a good choice on the DD + 3 Attacks set, as it gives Kingdra more setup opportunities and makes Outrage confusion less of a problem. Unless you are using a rain team, Sniper is given the nod over Swift Swim to boost the potential critical hit.The EVs are chosen to maximize Attack, with an Adamant nature used to boost its Attack further. Speed is boosted to the point where you can outspeed Base 108s at +1, with the rest dumped in HP.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Substitute, if you have it, is usually the best choice if you are predicting a switch, or if you don\u2019t think the opponent can break it, as it gives a free opportunity to setup without fear of critical hits, status or super effective hits. Behind a Substitute, choosing whether or not to use Dragon Dance can be difficult. For example, if they have a Scarfed Hydreigon waiting in the wings, using Dragon Dance is pretty futile because you'll still be forced out or KOed. So, in a situation like this, 2 Waterfalls are better than DD + Waterfall. Also, KOing something slower while behind a Substitute is preferable to letting your Substitute die for a Dragon Dance, as you can either set up or threaten the following switch-in while behind a Sub.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Just like most Kingdra sets, this benefits greatly from entry hazards, as it often lacks the power, even with STAB and +1, to break through bulky attackers or walls. Sticky Web is also a big asset, as this slows down grounded Scarfers to the point where they can be outsped at +1, which is a huge help if going for a sweep. Another helpful team option is to have something like Calm Mind Jirachi or Nasty Plot Celebi to set up on and threaten physical walls DD Kingdra will certainly bait out, such as Tangrowth. Also, a Steel-type is a good defensive partner, as they resist both of Kingdra's two weaknesses in Fairy and Dragon.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>This Kingdra set is used to sweep in the rain with its Swift Swim boost and the boost to its Water-type STAB. Hydro Pump is Kingdra's most powerful Water-type STAB move, as it deals massive damage to anything in the rain and is generally the preferred choice. Its shaky accuracy can be a problem, so Surf can be used as a more reliable alternative. Draco Meteor is a secondary STAB move; it is powerful, though a use of it will halt Kingdra's sweep. It is essential in breaking through bulky Water-types, and other things that resist Hydro Pump. Outrage is the main option here, as it can be used after a Draco Meteor to beat many threats that would otherwise wall you after the Special Attack drop, such as Rotom-W and Mega Venusaur. It also is great against Rotom-W and specially defensive Pokemon, but it does have a nasty side effect of locking Kingdra into it, so Rain Dance can be used instead to lessen Kingdra's reliance on Politoed to sweep. Waterfall is a physical Water-type STAB move that deals hefty damage to Blissey and Chansey in rain, and like Outrage, it is an excellent move to use after a Draco Meteor; it is also helpful in breaking through specially defensive Tyranitar variants. However, Surf can be used in this slot as a reliable special Water-type STAB move. Ice Beam is a handy coverage move to 2HKO Grass-type threats, including Celebi after Stealth Rock, but it is often out-damaged by Kingdra's other moves, especially in the rain, while as an alternative to Draco Meteor, Dragon Pulse is good for Water-types when the Draco Meteor Special Attack drop is undesirable; as always, the accuracy is helpful as well.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Kingdra uses full Special Attack investment, as it is its most commonly used offensive stat, and 192 Speed EVs let it outrun Deoxys-S in the rain. All of the remaining EVs should be put into Attack to benefit Outrage and Waterfall. Alternatively, one can run a spread of 32 Atk / 240 SpA / 228 Spe, allowing Kingdra to outpace Choice Scarf Latios in the rain, or 80 Atk / 252 SpA / 176 Spe to outspeed anything up until Choice Scarf Garchomp. Sets using no physical moves should run a Modest nature and use a spread of 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe. Life Orb is the preferred item to boost the power of Kingdra without locking it into one move.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Rain doesn't last long, whether from a Politoed with a Damp Rock or Kingdra's own Rain Dance. Make sure to take advantage of the amount of time you have; use it as efficiently as possible. If you predict a foe to switch out, use the appropriate move to dent the switch-in rather than doing negligible damage to them. Kingdra sweeps best late-game after foes like Ferrothorn are removed, but if it is a win condition for you earlier in the game, go for it. With Life Orb and Kingdra's susceptibility to all entry hazards, it is wise to bring Kingdra in on a double switch or after a teammate has fainted. However, its handy 4x resistances to Fire- and Water-type moves does allow it the reassurance of being able to safely switch in on these moves.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Politoed is a mandatory partner for the rain it provides, particularly for sets that don't run Rain Dance. Other rain setters such as Deoxys-S work well on the sort of offensive teams that Kingdra fits on. Kingdra should also be paired with other rain sweepers such as Ludicolo, Kabutops, Tornadus-T, and Keldeo. Magnezone and Gothitelle are great partners, as they can eliminate Ferrothorn with Hidden Power Fire; bear in mind that this should be done before rain is set up. Rotom-W makes for a good partner, as it can easily deal with Azumarill while also aiding Kingdra in entering the battle safely with Volt Switch. As mentioned before, Keldeo is a good partner not only because it benefits from rain, but also because it break through Blissey and Chansey. Thundurus can break through bulky Water-types with impunity, and can use U-turn to keep up momentum. Kingdra is also worn down quickly by Life Orb, so Rapid Spin or Defog support is often required to enable Kingdra to stay alive as long as possible. Scizor and Starmie both benefit from rain, so they are generally good choices.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>This is the set that made Kingdra a top tier threat in Generations IV and V. The main move on this set is Rain Dance, which in combination with Swift Swim, doubles Kingdra's speed. This means that one move turns Kingdra from a slightly slow attacker into an extremely threatening sweeper. And now in the rain, STAB Hydro Pumps will absolutely tear every apart, dealing immense damage even to dedicated walls. Draco Meteor is a good choice for secondary STAB, hitting the Water-type resists for strong 130 Base Power STAB. The last slot goes to Waterfall, providing a 100% accurate STAB attack, along with the rain boost and the ability to hit special walls on the physical side.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The EVs are chosen to outpace Scarf Mienshao in rain, along with the other base 105 Scarfers. The remainder are poured into Special Attack, with the leftovers put into Attack to boost the power of Waterfall. A Mild Nature is also chosen, because Kingdra has no need for more speed and the special attacking side is more important than the physical side.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>While setting up rain is usually Kingdra's first priority when running this set, preserving health is often very important, so taking out a weakened slower threat with an attacking move is usually preferable to setting up rain, because taking the hit in return is often worse, especially considering Kingdra has no Leftovers. You always have the choice to predict the opponent's switch and set up rain, but this can be dangerous. Also, when in rain, Hydro Pump is your most damaging attack, but also your least accurate, so Waterfall is recommended if the power is not needed.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Grass and Electric-types are good partners, because this Kingdra's biggest threat are bulky Waters which are specially defensive enough to take Draco Meteors. Therefore, strong threats that hit those for super effective damage such as Shaymin are effective teammates. Also, specially defensive Florges is coaxed out as well, so things like Subtitue Swords Dance Cobalion can come in and start setting up and attempt to take over the game. Sub CM Jirachi also works just as well. Also, just like the last set, good team utility from entry hazards is very helpful, but even more so for a dedicated sweeper like this Kingdra. Team utility can also come in the form of rain setters, as this can save the turn of setting up.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>This set plays as an excellent wallbreaker, blasting holes in teams with its STAB moves. Hydro Pump is the most powerful Water-type STAB move Kingdra has access too, and it is used to punch holes in things early-game, making it easy for a teammate to clean up. Draco Meteor is mainly for blasting holes in the Pokemon that resist Water, including Dragon-types such as Dragonite, Latios, and Kyurem-B. Surf is used as your reliable STAB move for the late-game, though Scald is an option as well. While the difference between the two may seem inconsequential, Surf's higher power lends Kingdra the ability to clean through teams more easily, while Scald's burn chance is in particular really helpful for Kingdra as the burn cripples some of its best checks, such as Ferrothorn, Azumarill, and Mega Venusaur. There isn't really much that can be covered with the last slot, but Ice Beam does the most against bulky Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Chesnaught, Dragon Pulse is another reliable STAB move which can be used against Pokemon such as Garchomp without forcing you out, and finally, Sleep Talk is an option as you have what you will need the majority of the time in the first three moveslots, so Kingdra can be used to absorb the sleep move and possibly still be able to blast through things later in the game, as rain will likely be up.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>With the specified EV spread, Kingdra outruns Deoxys-S in the rain, has full Special Attack investment, and saves the rest of the EVs for bulk. Kingdra is fast enough in the rain for it to not require a Speed-boosting nature, so Modest is perfectly fine.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This set should only be used on dedicated Rain teams; it offers very little over choices such as Keldeo on a weatherless team. It also must be stressed that while rain is not permanent, this set is bothered less by this, as it doesn't have to worry much about predicting with its attacks as Hydro Pump and Surf are often powerful enough to 2HKO most foes. If using Scald, and Kingdra comes into play while you see that the other team has a Ferrothorn or an Azumarill, you should always use Scald, as those Pokemon will be your most likely switch-in, and the chance to burn them is invaluable.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>The team options for this set are very similar to those of the first set, except this set does not use Rain Dance, making it rely much more on rain set by other Pokemon. Politoed is the probably the most essential, as its good bulk and ability to setup rain automatically put it in high demand. Deoxys-S is another great choice, as it can set up rain quickly as well as Stealth Rock, which makes it valuable when using Kingdra on heavily hyper offense-oriented teams. On these teams, other rain sweepers are recommended, with Kabutops being one of the the best, but Ludicolo, Seismitoed, and Tornadus-T are other Pokemon that work quite well. Each offers many different advantages to your rain team: Ludicolo threatens bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W, Seismitoed is immune to Thundurus's priority Thunder Wave, which stops most rain sweepers cold, and Tornadus-T can use its STAB Hurricanes at full accuracy in the rain, while also being a useful pivot with U-turn, Regenerator, and its high base Speed. If you're veering towards alternate rain setters, Tornadus has priority on Rain Dance thanks to its Prankster ability, and can also take advantage of the rain with Hurricane.</p>\n"
