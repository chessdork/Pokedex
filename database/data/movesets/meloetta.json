     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Psyshock is Meloetta's primary STAB move and hits opposing Assault Vest users and specially defensive walls for heavy damage. Hyper Voice is a secondary STAB move that is great at getting strong neutral damage. Focus Blast prevents Steel-type Pokemon from walling Meloetta and is an excellent way of destroying Dark-type switch-ins. Shadow Ball inflicts a lot of damage to Pokemon like Celebi and Metagross and is excellent at breaking specially defensive sets thanks to Serene Grace, which gives it a 40% chance to lower Special Defense. Thunderbolt is an excellent way of getting past bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Vaporeon and can OHKO most Flying-types. If Sableye is troublesome, then Meloetta can opt for Dazzling Gleam over Focus Blast, but it gives Meloetta less power and coverage.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>248 HP EVs give Meloetta an extra Stealth Rock switch-in while also maximizing its bulk. With maximum Special Attack and a Modest nature, Meloetta can deal lots of damage while also retaining excellent special bulk thanks to Assault Vest; for instance, Choice Specs Hydreigon barely manages a 2HKO on Meloetta. Serene Grace gives Meloetta the ability to wallbreak opposing Pokemon with Special Defense drops from Focus Blast and Shadow Ball while also giving Thunderbolt a higher chance to paralyze opposing Pokemon.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Don't use Meloetta recklessly, as even though it can take special attacks extremely well, it has no reliable recovery. Ideally, it should switch into a neutral special attack and deal out as much damage as possible while trying to avoid physical hits and strong special attacks.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Pokemon that can take the physical hits that Meloetta can't make great teammates. Cleric support in the form of Wish and Heal Bell or Aromatherapy can help increase Meloetta's longevity drastically. Meloetta doesn't want to take excessive damage because it has no reliable recovery, so it appreciates the support that Pokemon like Blastoise and Aerodactyl can provide by getting rid of entry hazards using Rapid Spin or Defog respectively. Aromatisse is an excellent partner for Meloetta due to its nifty resistances to Dark- and Bug-type moves, its ability to take physical hits rather well, and its access to Wish and Aromatherapy.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Hyper Voice is the main draw in using Choice Scarf Meloetta, as it is a powerful STAB move that allows Meloetta to revenge kill opposing Pokemon even if they are behind a Substitute. Psyshock allows Meloetta to revenge kill some key Pokemon in the tier, most notably Hitmonlee and Gallade. Shadow Ball has perfect neutral coverage with Hyper Voice and also deals with threatening Pokemon like Doublade and Delphox. The last slot is a choice between generating momentum and scouting the opponent with U-turn or crippling an opposing defensive Pokemon with Trick. Focus Blast is also an option if your team is extremely weak to Cobalion.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Max Speed and a Timid nature are chosen, as this allows Meloetta to outspeed opposing Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Rotom-C and Hitmonlee when equipped with its own Choice Scarf.  Special Attack is maximized in order to hit as hard as possible.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Meloetta should be used to stop an opposing sweeper from running through your team after they have set up. However, try not to switch Meloetta directly into an opponent's attack after they have set up, as this could cause you to lose your only chance to revenge kill them. Trick and U-turn are capable of crippling or scouting your opponent's best response to Meloetta, respectively.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Something that is capable of taking out opposing Registeel is greatly appreciated by Meloetta. Cobalion and Virizion are both good options, that can set up on or KO opposing Registeel. Pokemon that are capable of luring in and getting rid of opposing special walls such as Moltres.Hitmonlee deserves a special mention, as it deals with special walls while also providing Rapid Spin support to prevent Choice Scarf Meloetta from getting worn down by entry hazards.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Psyshock is the main STAB move on this set, dealing heavy damage to everything that does not resist it. Psychic can be used in this slot instead if your team is having issues with certain Pokemon like Alomomola or Tangrowth. Focus Blast is chosen as the secondary move, tearing through Steel- and Dark-types that resist or are immune to Psyshock. Particularly, Focus Blast nails Registeel, one of the main switch-ins into Meloetta.  Shadow Ball rounds out Meloetta's coverage, hitting some key Pokemon such as Delphox, Doublade, and Bronzong super effectively. In the last slot, Meloetta chooses between crippling any wall that attempts to switch in to its attacks with Trick or gaining momentum on forced switches with U-turn.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Max Speed and a Timid nature are chosen for this set, as base 90 Speed is relatively common in RU. Max Special Attack along with Choice Specs allows Meloetta to become an extremely powerful wallbreaker, demolishing Pokemon that usually give Meloetta trouble.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Using Choice Specs Meloetta is fairly simple. Use a slow U-turn or Volt Switch to get Meloetta in, or switch Meloetta in after something faints and use the move most likely to decimate the opponent or their switch-in. Trick and U-turn can be used early-game in order to cripple or scout your opponent's best switch-in to Meloetta. Choice Specs Meloetta should always be used primarily as a wallbreaker, and not as a sweeper.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Pokemon that like weakened special walls, especially Registeel, appreciate the wallbreaking capabilities of this Meloetta set.  Jolteon is another good teammate for Meloetta, as it is capable of cleaning late-game with its blazing Speed stat after the opponent's special walls are weakened. Choice Specs Meloetta is very good at taking advantage of all different types of entry hazards. Shuckle is capable of providing Sticky Web support as well Stealth Rock support. Accelgor and Qwilfish are both good partners for Meloetta, as they can help in wearing down special walls by providing Spikes support.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Relic Song is obviously the most important move on this set, allowing Meloetta to become one of the most dangerous physical threats in RU. Return and Close Combat are chosen as STAB moves for Meloetta, as they have very good neutral coverage in the tier. Knock Off rounds out Meloetta's coverage, allowing it to do heavy damage to Ghost-types. Ice Punch and Zen Headbutt are also interesting options for Meloetta, as they allow Meloetta to get through Gligar and Weezing, respectively, and thanks to Serene Grace, Zen Headbutt has a nice 40% chance to flinch. Quick Attack and Facade are also options to replace Return, providing Meloetta with priority in Quick Attack's case or allowing it to negate the Attack drop from burn with Facade.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Max Speed and a Jolly nature are chosen to take advantage of Meloetta-P's high 128 base Speed, making Meloetta one of the fastest Pokemon in the tier. Maximum Attack investment and Life Orb allow Meloetta to hit as hard as possible.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>It is important to realize when playing with this set that your opponent is likely going to assume that you are using a special variant of Meloetta. It is best to send in Meloetta against a weak Pokemon that is slower than regular Meloetta and pick them off with Relic Song, which still hits pretty hard off of regular Meloetta's high Special Attack set. Meloetta-P is best used as a late-game cleaner, after the opponent's team has been worn down a little bit, but it is also a capable wallbreaker, thanks to its high Base Power STAB moves and good coverage.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Spikes setters such as Qwilfish, Accelgor, and Omastar make really good teammates for Meloetta, as this set tends to force a second switch after Relic Song is revealed. Meloetta struggles to get around certain physically defensive Pokemon, such as Alomomola and Gligar, so something that can take advantage of these Pokemon make good partners. Virizion is one such Pokemon, capable of setting up on both of these Pokemon with either Calm Mind or Swords Dance.  Thanks to Knock Off, Ghost-type Pokemon don't wall this set, but they can switch into Relic Song and stop the transformation. As such, Pursuit users like Escavalier and Drapion also make good partners. Finally, because this set tends to lure in and destroy Registeel, Pokemon like Slurpuff that struggle with Registeel enjoy being paired with this set.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Meloetta is capable of forcing a large amount of switches, and this set aims to take advantage of that with Calm Mind. Calm Mind boosts Meloetta's Special Attack and Special Defense, making it very powerful and much harder to take down. Hyper Voice and Shadow Ball have extremely good coverage in RU, and Hyper Voice is capable of hitting through opposing Substitutes. Focus Blast allows Meloetta to get around specially defensive Steel-types, such as Registeel, that don't mind Meloetta's other moves.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Max Special Attack and Speed with a Timid nature are used so Meloetta can hit as hard and fast as possible. A Life Orb is used to boost Meloetta's already strong attacks.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This set tends to work best as a mid-game wallbreaker, as it is capable of punching large holes in defensive teams, allowing a teammate to clean up late-game. Calm Mind is best used on predicted switches, but against more offensive teams, Meloetta's good coverage and natural power can allow Meloetta to function well without a boost.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>This set works well on teams that attempt to spam special attacks in order to wear down the opponent. Pairing Meloetta with another bulkier Calm Mind user such as Reuniclus or Cresselia could work well, as this set can really damage usual Calm Mind counters such as Registeel and Drapion. Spikes users such as Accelgor and Qwilfish are also good options, as many of the best responses to Meloetta are grounded Pokemon.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Relic Song is the most important move in this set as it allows Meloetta to transform into Meloetta-P, and thankfully, it has a 20% chance to make the opposing Pokemon fall asleep as well, so it isn't an entirely useless move. Close Combat is Meloetta-P's main STAB move and can effectively punch holes in teams. Return gives Meloetta-P a strong STAB move that hits much of the metagame neutrally. Knock Off is Meloetta-P's best way of dealing with Ghost-types that would otherwise wall it, also hitting the Psychic-types that threaten it for heavy damage.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>With maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature, Meloetta-P outspeeds most of the tier after transforming. Maximum Attack gives Meloetta-P the power to pound through the opposition with relative ease. A Jolly nature is preferred to enable Meloetta-P to outspeed as much as possible, but an Adamant nature can be run to give it even more power. Life Orb helps Meloetta-P dish out as much damage as it can. Relic Song gets a 20% chance to make the opposing Pokemon fall asleep thanks to Serene Grace.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Meloetta-P is an excellent mid- to late-game cleaner and can play mind games with the opponent as to whether Meloetta is going to transform or not. Try to avoid using Meloetta-P early in the match because it takes a turn to transform every time it switches in. Try to use Meloetta-P after Choice Scarf users and Pokemon that naturally outspeed it are taken out.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Entry hazards like Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Sticky Web can help Meloetta-P in its sweep immensely by securing OHKOs for it and slowing down potentially Choice Scarf users. Shuckle can provide Stealth Rock and Sticky Web support, and while Forretress can provide Stealth Rock and Spikes support. Meloetta-P hates status, so Pokemon that can absorb status like Guts Machamp can be great teammates. Meloetta-P can't outspeed Choice Scarf users, so a Pokemon that can wall them, such as Quagsire or Florges, are appreciated.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Perish Song is a very important move for specially defensive Meloetta, as it prevents common stallbreakers such as Substitute + Calm Mind Cresselia, Calm Mind Reuniclus, and Curse Registeel from setting up and slowly taking down your team. Knock Off hits many of the things that Meloetta wants to wall for more damage than any of its special attacks, 2HKOing Delphox after Stealth Rock. Heal Bell gives Meloetta some added utility, allowing it to cure its teammates' status ailments. U-turn is another option in this slot, however, as it allows Meloetta to gain momentum on switches forced by Perish Song. Thunder Wave is chosen for the last slot, as it can cripple Delphox and other speedy special attackers. Toxic can be used in this slot, but many common switch-ins to Meloetta are immune to Toxic, such as Registeel and Drapion.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Max HP, Special Defense, and a Careful nature are necessary to check Calm Mind Delphox. Leftovers are necessary, as it is Meloetta's only form of recovery.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>If you see that your opponent has a Cresselia or Reuniclus in the team preview, it is necessary to keep Meloetta as healthy as possible, as these Pokemon can be huge threats to defensively oriented teams. While Meloetta does have impressive special bulk, its physical bulk isn't that great, so avoiding physical hits as much as possible will greatly increase Meloetta's longevity. Knock Off is especially important to avoid, as it not only hits Meloetta super effectively, it also removes Meloetta's only form of recovery. That being said, Meloetta is great at pivoting into special attackers and forcing them out.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>This set greatly appreciates Wish support from the likes of Alomomola and Aromatisse. Alomomola also appreciates Meloetta's cleric abilities, preventing Alomomola from being worn down by Toxic. On the other hand, Aromatisse is able to use Aromatherapy to free up a moveslot for Meloetta's U-turn. Pokemon that switch out of Psychic-type Pokemon appreciate Meloetta's ability to counter these Pokemon. Gligar and Golbat both need this type of support, and in return can provide Defog support to prevent Meloetta from being worn down by entry hazards. Finally, a good switch-in to Dark-types really helps Meloetta succeed in its roll; Hitmontop and Aromatisse are both good choices.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Substitute is the most important move on this set, as it protects Meloetta from status moves, such as Toxic. Calm Mind boosts Meloetta's Special Attack and Special Defense, making it more threatening as well as harder to take down. Hyper Voice and Shadow Ball provide perfect neutral coverage in the tier.  Shadow Ball is very important on this set, as it allows Meloetta to counter Doublade, one of the best Pokemon in the tier. Hyper Voice has the additional benefit of allowing Meloetta to hit through an opponent's Substitute, which can be helpful if they attempt to set up at the same time as you do.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The EVs give Meloetta 404 HP, allowing its Substitutes to take a Seismic Toss from Registeel, while the Defense EVs allow Meloetta's Substitute to take any hit from 0 Attack Gligar barring Knock Off. 44 Speed EVs allow Meloetta to outspeed uninvested base 95 Speed Pokemon such as Drapion. The remaining EVs are placed into Special Attack along with a Modest Nature, to make Meloetta as threatening as possible. Leftovers is mandatory on this set, as it is Meloetta's only form of recovery.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Meloetta is able to scare out a lot of Pokemon with the variety of its sets, some of which can be more dangerous initially. Pokemon such as Golbat, Gligar, and Alomomola are likely to switch out when you bring Meloetta in, allowing Meloetta to set up a Substitute or a Calm Mind. You must be very careful switching Meloetta into these Pokemon, however, as a Toxic or a Scald burn makes this set much less effective. Switching into Knock Off is also a problem, as even a weak one cripples this set by removing its only form of recovery. If you use this set, Toxic Spikes is something you should really consider, as it puts a timer on your opponent, making this set even more effective at wearing down the opponent's team.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>A grounded Poison-type or some other entry hazard remover make a really good teammate for Meloetta, as Toxic Spikes make this set much less effective. Meloetta also has trouble getting around Registeel, so something that can deal with that is also very useful.  Hitmonlee is not only capable of removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin, but it laughs in Registeel's face. Hitmonlee also lures in set up opportunities such as Alomomola and Gligar for Meloetta. Aromatisse is another good partner for Meloetta, as it can switch into Knock Off without breaking a sweat, as well as utilize Aromatherapy to give a status-ridden Meloetta a second chance. Finally, a good Toxic Spikes setter allows Meloetta to take advantage of its natural bulk and Substitute to stall out the opponents team; both Drapion and Weezing are very adept at this role.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Meloetta already has amazing Special Attack and Special Defense stats, and Calm Mind boosts these stats to even greater levels, putting offensive pressure on the opponent as well as preparing it for a sweep. Substitute is Meloetta's best way of avoiding status and can give it more setup opportunities, putting further offensive pressure on the opponent. After a Calm Mind boost, Psyshock hits very hard, dealing heavy damage in particular to special walls, Assault Vest users, and opposing Calm Mind users. Thunderbolt hits common Calm Mind users and bulky Water-types for super effective damage and enables Meloetta to easily win Calm Mind wars. If Dark-types are problematic, then Meloetta can use Focus Blast to secure KOs on these threatening Pokemon. Dazzling Gleam can be used as a more accurate way to hit Dark-types and prevent Sableye from walling Meloetta, but it lacks the coverage and the power that Focus Blast has. Hyper Voice and Shadow Ball give perfect neutral coverage, but they don't give many super effective hits.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>A Timid nature and 120 Speed EVs allow Meloetta to outspeed Adamant Toxicroak while also outpacing every relevant wall in the tier. With maximum Special Attack, not many Pokemon can take a hit from +1 Meloetta-A. The remaining HP EVs give Meloetta a little more bulk and can potentially keep its Substitute up for another turn. Leftovers is the best Meloetta has for reliable recovery and can help the latter take another hit if it needs to.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Meloetta can beat opposing Calm Mind users like Suicune, so set up Calm Mind boosts on them or try to deal with them quickly with Thunderbolt. Don't stay in on strong Pokemon like Hydreigon or Houndoom unless Meloetta is behind a Substitute; in that case, try to take them out quickly with Focus Blast.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Meloetta is vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards, so Rapid Spinners such as Forretress and Tentacruel and Defog users such as Crobat and Empoleon can help by removing entry hazards. Pokemon like Sableye and Jirachi can burn or paralyze opposing Pokemon, respectively, to potentially give Meloetta another setup opportunity. Physical walls such as Suicune can stop the strong physical attackers that would otherwise tear Meloetta apart and are thus great teammates for it. Aromatisse and Alomomola are excellent physical walls that can also provide status support.</p>\n"
