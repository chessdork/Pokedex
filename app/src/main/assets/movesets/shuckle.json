     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Sticky Web is Sticky Web, and Shuckle's number one mission is to set it up. Stealth Rock creates a nice entry hazard combination with Sticky Web, as it does a lot of damage to the Flying-types that are immune to Sticky Web. Encore is very important, as without it, Shuckle is huge setup bait. It also generates useful momentum for Shuckle's team. Infestation is useful for racking up damage and trapping opponents. It also has no immunities and isn't affected by Taunt, unlike Toxic. However, if your team deals with Steel- and Poison-types fairly well, Toxic can go in the last slot, as it does more damage over time and doesn't go away after a few turns like Infestation does. Knock Off is a great utility move for Shuckle to use, as it cripples Pokemon that rely heavily on their items, such as Heatran and Chansey, but it is quite weak coming from an uninvested Shuckle and can get in the way of other Knock Off users.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>252 EVs with a Bold nature give Shuckle maximum bulk on the physical side, while minimizing Foul Play and confusion damage. Mental Herb gives Shuckle a chance against users of Taunt, Trick, and status, allowing it to get up at least one of its hazards. Sturdy ensures that Shuckle will lay down either Sticky Web or Stealth Rock without getting OHKOed.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>As a general rule of thumb, use Stealth Rock before Sticky Web when the opponent has a Pokemon that is 4x weak to it, or when the opponent has two or more Pokemon immune to Sticky Web. Otherwise, use Sticky Web first. Once you have laid down hazards, use a combination of Infestation and Encore to trap the opponent, and switch to an appropriate counter. However, do not hesitate to use Encore if you predict a setup move. Also use Encore when you predict a Rapid Spin or Defog. One of two things will happen: they will switch out, and you get Sticky Web up on the switch, or they stay in, and you switch to a setup sweeper and attempt a sweep from there. Shuckle is best used as a lead, setting up hazards and using Infestation and Encore to mess with your opponent, switching out whenever necessary. If you need to, don't be afraid to fodder Shuckle, as its main job is to set up hazards. However, if you spot a potential Rapid Spin or Defog user on the opposing team, you should save Shuckle in order to set up hazards again. </p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Shuckle should only be used on teams that intend to abuse Sticky Web to its fullest. Therefore, Shuckle works well with any Pokemon that has high Attack or Special Attack and middling Speed; examples include, but are not limited to, Manaphy, Chandelure, Kyurem-B, Haxorus, Dragonite, Hydreigon, Landorus-T, Mamoswine, Exploud, Darmanitan, Mega Gardevoir, Mega Medicham, and Mega Charizard Y. Bisharp is almost necessary for its ability to take advantage of Defog users; something that Shuckle absolutely hates. Mega Heracross, Keldeo, and Terrakion can take care of opposing Bisharp trying to take advantage of Sticky Web, and benefit from Sticky Web as well. Ghost-types, such as Gengar, are also useful for blocking Rapid Spin.</p>\n"

Stealth Rock complements Sticky Web well, as it does a lot of damage to the Flying-types that are immune to Sticky Web. Encore is very important, as without it, Shuckle is huge setup bait for Pokemon such as Houndoom and Vivillon. It also generates useful momentum for Shuckle's team by forcing switches. Toxic is great for racking up damage and crippling threatening Pokemon. Knock Off is a great utility move for Shuckle to use, as it can cripple Pokemon that heavily rely on their items, such as Gligar, but it is quite weak coming from an uninvested base 20 Attack stat and can get in the way of other Knock Off users. Infestation can be used over Toxic to wear down Steel- and Poison-types, but against all other Pokemon, it's generally inferior. However, it does have the advantage of being able to trap the opponent, creating momentum.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>248 EVs in HP and full investment in Special Defense with a Calm nature gives Shuckle maximum bulk on the special side while minimizing damage from Foul Play, Stealth Rock, and confusion. A specially defensive spread is generally preferred over a physically defensive one in order to face down Pokemon such as Houndoom, but a physically defensive spread can be used if your team handles special attackers well. A Careful nature is preferred if Knock Off is used in the last slot. The rest of the EVs are thrown into Defense. Mental Herb gives Shuckle a chance against users of Taunt and status and guarantees the setup of at least one of its hazards. However, Leftovers can be used for more longevity in order to set up hazards multiple times a match if needed, but make sure to have an answer to Taunt leads, which are common in the metagame. Sturdy ensures that Shuckle will lay down either Sticky Web or Stealth Rock without getting OHKOed.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>As a general rule of thumb, use Stealth Rock before Sticky Web if the opponent has a Pokemon that is 4x weak to it, or if the opponent has two or more Pokemon that are immune to Sticky Web.

Therefore, Shuckle works well with any Pokemon that has high Attack or Special Attack and middling Speed; examples include, but are not limited to, Chandelure, Hydreigon, Exploud, Darmanitan, Victini, Nidoking, and Entei. Ghost-types are useful for blocking Rapid Spin, Chandelure and Trevenant being good examples. Magic Bounce users such as Xatu and Mega Absol also make great teammates, as they will usually deter the opponent from crippling Shuckle or setting up hazards of their own if they know a Pokemon with Magic Bounce is waiting in the wings.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Sticky Web is the sole reason to use Shuckle; its bulk and Sturdy make it a reliable user of the move. The rest of Shuckle's moveset is devoted to ensuring it isn't setup bait. Encore is Shuckle's main defense, allowing it to thwart setup attempts from sweepers such as Geomancy Xerneas and Swords Dance Arceus. Encore can also lock Defog or Rapid Spin users into the move, allowing Shuckle to lay Sticky Web again and then switch to an appropriate counter or a spinblocker. Toxic punishes common Defog users such as Arceus and Giratina-O for coming in and is Shuckle's primary way of dealing damage if needed. Although Rock Tomb does virtually nothing coming off of Shuckle's horrendous Attack stat, it is necessary to punish Mega Gengar leads by dropping its Speed so it cannot trap Shuckle for free once Mental Herb is gone and then proceed to KO something else with Destiny Bond; Rock Tomb also helps against big threats to Sticky Web teams such as Yveltal, Thundurus, and Mega Mewtwo Y. If you think you can handle these Pokemon, Stealth Rock can be used instead; however, Shuckle does not usually have enough time to set up both entry hazards, and forgoing Rock Tomb leaves it completely vulnerable to Taunt users once Mental Herb is gone.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Always invest fully in HP and Special Defense, as Shuckle's other stats are too low to consider doing anything else. Investing in Special Defense over Defense is preferred because the most common Defog user in the tier, Arceus, almost always uses special attacks. For example, 4 SpA Arceus formes can only 4HKO Shuckle with type-neutral Judgment, giving it a chance to punish them with Toxic and Encore. Shuckle can also survive an unboosted Hydro Pump from Palkia after Stealth Rock damage, a testament to its bulk.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Shuckle should try to set up Sticky Web as soon as possible. That being said, do not lead with Shuckle if the enemy has a Pokemon such as Darkrai or Jirachi that prevents Sticky Web from going up on the first turn; Shuckle will just be forced to switch out. If the enemy does not have one of the aforementioned Pokemon or a user of Defog or Rapid Spin, feel free to lead with Shuckle and let it go after it has successfully set up Sticky Web. However, if there is an Excadrill or a possible Defog user such as Scizor, Giratina-O, or Arceus on the enemy team that your team cannot completely shut down, try to preserve Shuckle until the enemy's Defog or Rapid Spin user has been appropriately dealt with.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>The best teammates for Shuckle are offensive Pokemon that can help preserve Sticky Web or counter the leads that can stop it from doing its job. Defog is the most common way of removing Sticky Web, which makes Taunt users such as Yveltal, Mewtwo, and Thundurus invaluable. Mewtwo is particularly useful because it can outspeed and OHKO Darkrai leads that might try to prevent Sticky Web from going up on the first turn with Dark Void. Shadow Tag is also an effective way of removing Defog users from the game; Mega Gengar is a great choice that can also double as a spinblocker and Gothitelle can easily trap and KO most support Arceus formes. Other Ghost-types such as Ghost Arceus and Giratina-O can serve as effective spinblockers as well.</p>\n<p>There are also some unconventional ways to stop Defog users. One way is a powerful Explosion: the attack will inflict massive damage to Scizor and support Arceus formes and cause Defog to fail at the cost of the Explosion user. Landorus-T and Genesect are notable Explosion users that work well on Sticky Web teams. Another way is to use powerful setup sweepers such as Geomancy Xerneas or Swords Dance Arceus to help dissuade Defog, as the opponent taking a turn to use the move could open up a setup opportunity. If you want to go on a simpler route, sheer offensive pressure from very powerful Pokemon such as Kyogre, Dialga, Palkia, Mega Lucario, or Mega Charizard X can also take down common Defog users such as Scizor, Giratina-O, and support Arceus formes before they even get a chance to use the move.</p>\n<p>Darkrai and Jirachi leads are big trouble for Shuckle because they can prevent it from setting up Sticky Web with Dark Void and Serene Grace Iron Head, respectively. Ditto leads can also be annoying as they can copy Shuckle and turn Sticky Web against you. Mewtwo is an effective way to handle Darkrai as mentioned before. Another good choice to handle Darkrai is Choice Scarf Genesect, which can KO Darkrai with U-turn and immediately bring in Shuckle to set up Sticky Web. Ground-types such as Groudon, Landorus-T, and Excadrill can effectively counter Jirachi leads. Excadrill is also the best way to handle Ditto, as it can simply spin away Sticky Web if Ditto attempts to set the entry hazard up against you. Generally, it is helpful to pack a Ground-type on Sticky Web teams to combat Prankster Thunder Wave from the likes of Klefki and Thundurus.</p>\n<p>Finally, running a Stealth Rock user is highly advised so Shuckle is not forced to give up Rock Tomb. Groudon, Landorus-T, Excadrill, Dialga, Mega Tyranitar, and Terrakion are all solid users of the move that work particularly well on Sticky Web teams. Mega Tyranitar and Terrakion also learn Taunt to help preserve their own Stealth Rock as well as Shuckle's Sticky Web, making them useful assets.</p>\n"
