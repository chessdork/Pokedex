     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Light Screen and Reflect allow Klefki to weaken incoming attacks for itself and its teammates, helping setup sweepers and giving frailer attackers more longevity. Thunder Wave is a helpful move to cripple faster attackers and works well when Klefki is paired with slower setup sweepers such as Azumarill and Mega Scizor. Safeguard protects Klefki's teammates from status, further aiding them in setting up. This works best with Pokemon that hate paralysis or burns, such as Mega Charizard X and Mega Tyranitar. Foul Play is used in the last slot, as it doesn't require Klefki to invest in a offensive stat, making it Klefki's best attacking option.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The EV spread guarantees Klefki will survive Modest Mega Charizard Y's Heat Wave behind Light Screen, with the rest of the EVs put in Defense for added bulk. Light Clay is used to keep dual screens up for longer, while Prankster is used to give priority to Klefki's support moves.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Klefki tends to work best early- to mid-game in order to set up dual screens and allow its teammates to better take hits. Thunder Wave Klefki can also be saved for late-game as a last resort against setup sweepers. Make sure to use Reflect against physical attackers, Light Screen against special attackers, and Safeguard against status users.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Setup sweepers appreciate dual screen support to more easily set up. Common setup sweepers include Mega Charizard X, (Mega) Tyranitar, Mega Gyarados, and Azumarill. These Pokemon also can take incoming Fire-type attacks, making them even more helpful. Frail attackers such as Shaymin-S, Excadrill and Genesect appreciate the ability to take an extra hit, allowing them to further damage the opponent. Mega Kangaskhan makes for a good teammate, especially if Klefki is using Safeguard, as it appreciates the immunity to burn and can take hits extremely well under dual screens. It also has Fake Out to help Klefki set up its support moves. Intimidate and Snarl support from the likes of Hitmontop, Salamence, Suicune, and Raikou can help Klefki survive longer, while rain support from Politoed helps Klefki better deal with Fire-types. In general, Pokemon that can deal with Klefki's two weaknesses such as Rotom-W, Latios, Talonflame, Salamence, and Mega Charizard Y make for good partners. Lastly, Pokemon such as Mamoswine, Tyranitar, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T can distract Thundurus and prevent it from using Taunt on Klefki.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>The goal of this set is to set up Reflect and Light Screen to benefit both Klefkiand its team. Not only do Light Screen and Reflect aid Klefki in setting up Spikes, but they also assist teammates trying to set up with boosting moves. Prankster is the icing on the cake, allowing Klefki to set up the relevant screenagainst the opponent regardless of Speed. Spikes provide even more support, benefiting teammates by potentially turning 2HKOs into OHKOs. Klefki's signature move, Fairy Lock, is an excellent move in the last slot, as it prevents both Pokemon in play from switching out in the turn after it is used, allowing it to be used as Klefki is about to be KOed so that a teammate that threatens the trapped Pokemon can setup behind the dual screens Klefki has set. However, one can use an offensive move in order for Klefki to not be total Taunt bait. Foul Play discourages physical attackers from setting up on Klefki, whereas Play Rough is a STAB attackthat 2HKOes Latios and Conkeldurr and is generally a more powerful option. Toxic can also be used to pressure Defog users such as Mandibuzz and Zapdos, which threaten to remove Klefki's Spikes and dual screens. Thunder Wave, another status move, can also be used, as the usefulness of Prankster Thunder Wave is immense in slowing down faster Pokemon.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Light Clay is the item of choice to increase the duration of Reflect and Light Screen to eight turns. Klefki invests in its Defense as much as possible in order to take attacks such as Earthquake easier. However, Klefki can easily be modified to tank hits better from special attackers by investing in its Special Defense.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This set does best as a lead for hyper offensive teams, as it gives frailer setupsweepers the bulk they need to set up and destroy teams. This includes teams with Shell Smash users, as most Shell Smash users have poor special bulk. It also helps frail wallbreakers destroy opposing offensive teams that would otherwise have the power to revenge kill them. It is not wise to sacrifice Klefki once it sets up dual screens to provide an advantage in momentum, as it can take advantage of its great typing and decent bulk to attempt to set up dual screens multiple times throughout the game. Fairy Lock should be used right before Klefki is about to be KOed so that a teammate can come in and either set up or KO the trapped Pokemon. An example is trapping Landorus before it uses Earth Power, so that Mamoswine can revenge kill it the next turn with Ice Shard.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>This Klefki set works wonders on hyper offensive teams in need of a dual screens user that's resilient and can offer defensive synergy. Klefki doesn't need much support itself, so its teammates are almost always ones that require its support instead. Virtually all setup sweepers make great use of dual screen support, but examples of Pokemon that especially love it include Belly Drum Azumarill, Tail Glow Manaphy, Shell Smash Gorebyss, and Dragon Dance Mega Gyarados. Thundurus can form an effective double Prankster paralysis core, and it can also prevent Defog users from removing Klefki's dual screens with Taunt. Thundurus can also run a Defiant set to discourage Defog by threatening to come in and receive a +2 Attack boost. Defiant Bisharp can also receive a +2 Attack boost from Defog, making it a good partner as well.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Safeguard is a great move for protecting teammates from status, which is especially helpful for setup Pokemon that want as much power and Speed possible. When paired with Safeguard, Swagger allows Klefki to give its teammate a free +2 Attack boost. It can also confuse the opponent, though the Attack raise makes this very risky against physical attackers. Foul Play is Klefki's best way to damage the opponent as it deals a large amount to Pokemon with high Attack stats. It also does a lot of damage to Pokemon that have had their Attack stat raised by Swagger. Protect allows for Klefki to scout for attacks, punish double targeting, and protect itself from spread moves such as Earthquake and Heat Wave. Thunder Wave can also be used in the last slot to cripple faster attackers.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The EV spread with a Calm nature ensures Klefki will survive an Adamant Earthqauke from Landorus-T and Substitute Heatran's Heat Wave. Sitrus Berry is used for added longevity, while Prankster is used to allow Klefki's support moves to go first.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This set focuses on setting up Safeguard to protect Klefki's teammates from status, and then using Swagger to give them an Attack boost. Only use Swagger on your teammates when Safeguard has been set up, or else they have a 50% chance of doing a large amount of damage to themselves. Swagger should only be used against your opponent's as a last resort and should never be relied on to deal with a target. It can be used, however, if Klefki is out against special attackers and has no other way to support its team.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Pokemon that appreciate an Attack boost such as Mega Kangaskhan, Terrakion, and Conkeldurr all appreciate Klefki's ability to use Prankster Safeguard + Swagger. Pokemon that hate status such as Mega Gyarados, (Mega) Tyranitar, Azumarill, and Mega Lucario all love Safeguard support. Rotom-W, Talonflame, Latios, Salamence, and Mega Charizard Y all either resist or are immune to Klefki's two weaknesses, Fire and Ground, making them great partners. Water-types such as Azumarill and Keldeo can take Fire-type attacks for Klefki and have a super effective STAB move for Ground-types, making them helpful teammates. Heatran receives a boost from Fire-type attacks, so Klefki appreciates it as a partner. Klefki hates Prankster Taunt from Thundurus, making Mamoswine, Tyranitar, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T good partners to help deal with Thundurus.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Klefki can utilize Spikes to great effect with Prankster and stack multiple layers of the entry hazard quite easily to support its team. Thunder Wave is very useful to stop sweepers such as Xerneas and offensive Yveltal, and Klefki can usually paralyze faster sweepers thanks to Prankster. Klefki is not Defog bait either, as Toxic can severely punish support Arceus formes and Giratina-O that try to remove the Spikes it sets, in addition to deterring Ground-types and Ho-Oh from switching in. If your team has a lot of Toxic users or your team struggles with Gothitelle, Heal Block prevents Gothitelle from using Rest, in addition to Kefki having some stall breaking ability and being able to overcome defensive Palkia variants and Dark Arceus. Play Rough sounds like an odd choice, but it allows Klefki to break a Substitute from a standard Geomancy Xerneas as well as deal some damage to Yveltal, both of which Klefki checks.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Max HP and Special Defense EVs help Klefki check Yveltal and Xerneas, while allowing it to handle support Arceus formes better when they come in to Defog. The 8 Attack EVs give Play Rough the power to break a Substitute from Geomancy Xerneas, so Klefki can cripple it with Thunder Wave. A Careful nature maximizes Klefki's special bulk in order for it to check Xerneas and other specially offensive threats, and Leftovers increases Klefki's overall longevity.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Defoggers such as Arceus and Giratina-O are usually common switch-ins to Klefki in order to prevent it from setting up multiple layers of Spikes. Luring these Pokemon and smacking them with a Toxic is extremely helpful in limiting their opportunities to come in later to clear the field of entry hazards. Toxic is also very useful to surprise other common switch-ins, such as Ho-Oh, Groudon, and Landorus-T off-guard, all of which would walk all over Klefki otherwise. Even though Klefki is a great switch-in to Yveltal because of its typing, it needs to watch out for Taunt. Prankster Thunder Wave is a very good last-minute answer to most sweepers, so try not to lose Klefki to an opponent using certain sweepers such as Blaziken, Xerneas, and Choice Scarf users such as Kyogre. Despite Klefki's innate ability to check most of the Dragon-types in the tier, most of them have a way to break past it with their coverage moves, so attempting to wall them with Klefki is never a good idea.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Landorus-T forms an excellent entry hazard core with Klefki; its Ground immunity, access to Stealth Rock, and complementary typing to Klefki's make the two a good pair. Other Pokemon that are immune to Ground-type moves are also good teammates&mdash;Lugia and Yveltal definitely appreciate Spikes support in order to KO opponents more easily. Klefki does not like taking powerful Water-type attacks, especially in rain, so Pokemon such as Kyogre and Palkia that can take these hits for Klefki are solid partners. Mega Gengar can trap Defoggers for Klefki and either cripple them with Taunt or take them out with Destiny Bond, clearing the way for Klefki to set up Spikes. Sweepers that appreciate Spikes such as Xerneas, Blaziken, Rayquaza, and Extreme Killer Arceus love having Klefki as a partner, as it does not necessarily give up momentum for offensive teams. Overall, teams that want blanket checks to big threats such as Xerneas and Blaziken, wish to have priority Thunder Wave, or that do not want extremely specialized team members should definitely consider Klefki.</p>\n"
