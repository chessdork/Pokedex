     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Chandelure's STAB attacks get good coverage and let it revenge kill a variety of threats such as Jirachi, Shaymin, Roserade, and Alakazam. Energy Ball hits bulky Water-types harder than any of the moves on the set. Trick is a bit more useful on this set, as Choice Scarf Chandelure can have trouble dealing with dedicated special walls without it and also isn't inconvenienced in the offense department if it loses its item. Memento can be useful for giving setup opportunities to a teammate, especially one that sets up on Chandelure's counters.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature are used here, as this set's primary role is that of a revenge killer, but Modest can be used at the cost of being slower than Jolly Mega Aerodactyl. Maximum Special Attack investment lets it hit as hard as possible, scoring OHKOs on prominent threats such as Crobat and Nidoking.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Choice Scarf Chandelure makes for a good revenge killer thanks to its high power and great STAB combination, which allows it to revenge kill a variety of threats. As such, it should usually not be switching into attacks in order to keep it healthy for when it is needed. In addition to being a good revenge killer, Chandelure can also clean very effectively against weakened offensive teams, especially if it manages to get a Flash Fire boost from Pokemon such as Victini.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Fighting-types such as Mienshao work well with Chandelure, as the majority of its counters are weak to Fighting. Because it needs to switch in and out often to do its job effectively, Choice Scarf Chandelure really needs hazard removal support in order to function well. Teammates that appreciate Memento support such as Mega Absol, Lucario, and Infernape all make for good partners to Chandelure.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Overheat and Shadow Ball are Chandelure's main moves, with Overheat opening holes early-game and Shadow Ball covering Pokemon that resist Fire-type and cleaning up late-game. Hidden Power Fighting 2HKOes Tyranitar and OHKOes Bisharp, two Pokemon that can switch into at least one of Chandelure's STAB moves and trap it with Pursuit. On the other hand, Hidden Power Ice OHKOes Dragonite after Stealth Rock, Garchomp, Gliscor, and Landorus-T, while also hitting Tyranitar for a decent amount of damage. Trick cripples defensive Pokemon that wall Chandelure, such as Chansey, specially defensive Heatran, Alomomola, and Suicune. However, Energy Ball is Chandelure's best shot against Keldeo, Terrakion, Mega Gyarados, Manaphy, Rotom-W, and Azumarill, while also being its strongest move against Tyranitar, if it lacks Hidden Power Fighting. Will-O-Wisp can be used alongside Trick, as it allows Chandelure to bypass Bisharp's Sucker Punch and burn common checks and counters, such as Azumarill, Tyranitar, and Terrakion, after it has Tricked away its Choice Scarf. Memento is another move that can be used in the last slot, allowing Chandelure to reliably cripple Pokemon that it can't revenge kill, such +1 Mega Tyranitar and +1 Mega Gyarados, and let its teammates take care of them. Memento can also be used to provide setup chances for sweepers.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>A Modest nature is the best option for the extra power, which is one of Chandelure's main advantages as a Choice Scarf user. If, however, outspeeding Adamant Dragonite, Gyarados, and Mega Gyarados after one Dragon Dance is important, a Timid nature should be used, as well as Energy Ball and Hidden Power Ice, in order to allow Chandelure to revenge kill those threats effectively.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>If you need Chandelure to check a threatening Pokemon, play safely with it; if not, feel free to play recklessly and even Trick away Chandelure's item early-game in order to cripple key defensive Pokemon. However, beware of Pursuit users, especially Tyranitar. Making double switches and using Chandelure as a means of forcing switches is the best way to use it if Tyranitar is on the opposing team. There is no need to predict a lot if the opponent lacks a Pursuit user, as Overheat dents even some Pokemon which resist it, such as Keldeo, which faints the second time it switches in if Stealth Rock is up. Finally, beware of Mega Evolutions when you want to use Trick, especially specially defensive Mega Charizard X and Y, both of which wall Chandelure.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Pokemon that can take advantage of Tyranitar, Ground-types, Water-types, and special walls are good teammates, with Breloom and Keldeo being perfect for this job. Also, entry hazards removal support is needed in order for Chandelure to be able to switch in and out as freely as possible. Starmie is a great spinner in general and beats Tyranitar and most Ground-types with Hydro Pump; some Water-types such as Keldeo with Psyshock; and Gyarados, Alomomola, and Slowbro with Thunderbolt. Mega Scizor with U-turn and Defog can bring Chandelure in safely and check many Ground-types, such as Sand Rush Excadrill, Landorus-T, and Choice Scarf Garchomp; along with some Water-types, mainly Azumarill; and any Tyranitar without Fire Blast. Wallbreakers also pair well with Chandelure and help it clean up, especially those able to lure and weaken bulky Ground- and Water-types. Life Orb Swords Dance Terrakion is an excellent example of this, being able to lure, weaken, and even KO Slowbro, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon, while also being able to take advantage of Tyranitar.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Fire Blast and Shadow Ball provide a fantastic STAB combination. Hidden Power Fighting lets Chandelure hit Houndoom, Hydreigon, and Snorlax for super effective damage. Energy Ball lets Chandelure dispose of bulky Water-types such as Swampert, Suicune, and Mega Blastoise while also nailing things like Rhyperior and Hippowdon for super effective damage. Trick is useful for crippling walls such as Blissey, which would otherwise wall the set, and Overheat can be used as an alternative in the last slot over Trick in order to further accentuate Chandelure's incredibly high Special Attack; however, Fire Blast is usually strong enough in most scenarios and doesn't result in -2 Special Attack.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The given EV spread lets Chandelure hit as hard as possible and outspeed as much as possible. Timid can be run over Modest in order to outspeed Adamant Lucario and Adamant Krookodile, but more often than not, the extra power is more ideal.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Click Fire Blast or Shadow Ball and watch the opposing team's Pokemon faint. If they have certain switch-ins such as Hydreigon or Houndoom, try to nail them with Hidden Power Fighting , otherwise you're going to be clicking the STAB moves 90% of the time. Also, be careful when using Trick, as a Chandelure without any item is less effective so you want to try to keep your item for as long as possible unless it is worth the loss of boosted power.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Rapid Spin or Defog support from Pokemon such as Mega Aerodactyl or Starmie is appreciated, as Chandelure is weak to Stealth Rock and susceptible to all forms of entry hazards. This set really appreciates Sticky Web support from Shuckle or Galvantula, as Chandelure's low Speed can hold it back against offensive teams. Likewise, it also appreciates Stealth Rock and Spikes support to pressure its counters and to cause more damage in general, so Rapid Spin may be more ideal than Defog for this reason.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Shadow Ball is Chandelure's most spammable move and 2HKOes many Pokemon neutral to it. Fire Blast 2HKOes specially defensive Gliscor and OHKOes most Steel- and Grass-types, while Will-O-Wisp cripples Tyranitar and is more reliable than Fire Blast against Chansey, as Fire Blast's low PP can backfire against Chandelure. Without Will-O-Wisp, Chandelure can't do anything to Chansey, though you still win the PP war. Will-O-Wisp also deals with Azumarill, especially Assault Vest sets, which would otherwise be a big problem to Chandelure. Substitute eases prediction, helps avoid Bisharp's Sucker Punch, and lets Chandelure take advantage of Pokemon that can't break the Substitute, such as Clefable, Chansey, defensive Mega Venusaur, Ferrothorn, Heatran without Earth Power, Mega Scizor without Knock Off, and Amoonguss. Taunt shuts down the recovery of walls such as specially defensive Mega Charizard X, Chansey, Alomomola, and Suicune, letting Chandelure get past them and become an effective stallbreaker. Hex can be used over Shadow Ball when using Will-O-Wisp, as those two moves have great synergy together and give to Chandelure a 130 BP move against burned Pokemon. However, Hex is situational, as it's weaker than Shadow Ball against targets that aren't burned.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The EV spread allows Chandelure to outspeed Jolly Tyranitar, Adamant Bisharp, and Timid Magnezone and to make Substitutes that don't break from defensive Mega Venusaur's Sludge Bomb and Clefable's Moonblast. Flash Fire lets Chandelure check Mega Charizard Y and take advantage of the power boost it will sometimes get from Fire-type moves. If using Will-O-Wisp over Fire Blast, it is advised to use a Timid nature with a spread of 160 HP / 136 SpA / 212 Spe, in order to outrun Jolly Mega Heracross and Dragonite, along with Mega Gyarados and Gyarados before they set up a Substitute or OHKO Chandelure.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This set's main purpose is to help combat stall teams and break down defensive cores by taking advantage of certain Pokemon, such as Mega Venusaur, Clefable, Steel-types, and Chansey. Therefore, bring Chandelure in against one of those Pokemon and use Substitute or Taunt, depending on the situation. When you have a Substitute up, Chandelure can start doing some work with its attacks or Will-O-Wisp. Be sure to set up Stealth Rock before sending Chandelure in, as it needs the additional damage to pressure Mega Charizard X and Chansey - remember that Fire Blast only has 8 PP and is Chandelure's only way of doing damage to Chansey and 2HKOing specially defensive Gliscor. Against offensive teams you can play more recklessly with Chandelure and just try to deal as much damage as possible before going down, so don't be afraid to make aggressive double switches and risky plays, as Chandelure has little value against offensive teams anyway.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>A reliable Stealth Rock setter helps Chandelure harass its defensive checks, such as specially defensive variants of Mega Charizard X, Earth Power Heatran, Talonflame, and Gyarados, making it an essential tool for effective stallbreaking. Clefable, Taunt Terrakion, and Fire Blast Tyranitar are able to keep Stealth Rock up against the anti-hazard Pokemon of stall teams, such as bulky Starmie, Defog Skarmory, and Defog Zapdos. Chandelure appreciates anti-hazard support of its own, which means that Latios, Latias, and Starmie are all good partners; in addition, they also help against some of Chandelure's checks and counters, such as Keldeo and Garchomp. Finally, Chandelure also needs partners to cover Tyranitar, Water-, and Ground-types, all of which Mega Venusaur, Breloom, Keldeo, Amoonguss, and Rotom-W are all good at doing.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Substitute is used in order to avoid status and also to reliably set up on Pokemon such as Aromatisse, Florges, and Blissey, all of which are unable to break Chandelure's Substitute. Calm Mind boosts Chandelure's Special Attack to insane levels, making it capable of OHKOing the majority of the tier after a couple of boosts. Flamethrower is a reliable STAB move with decent power and, more importantly, higher PP than Fire Blast, an important factor in beating Blissey one-on-one. Fire Blast can be used for greater power but is generally an inferior option. Shadow Ball rounds out Chandelure's near perfect STAB combination and can help in Calm Mind wars due its secondary effect of dropping Special Defense.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The given spread allows Chandelure to never have it's Substitute broken by 4 Special Attack Florges and Pokemon such as Aromatisse. It also allows Chandelure to survive an unboosted Dark Pulse from Hydreigon after Stealth Rock with a Calm Mind boost and a Life-Orb boosted Dark Pulse without Stealth Rock after a Calm Mind boost. A Timid nature lets it outspeed Adamant Lucario and KO it with Flamethrower before it has the chance to hit Chandelure with a Crunch and it can also get the jump on neutral -natured base 90 Speed Pokemon such as Roserade. The rest of the EVs go into Special Attack, which allows Chandelure to 2HKO max HP Mega Blastoise after a Calm Mind boost with Shadow Ball.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Try to set up Chandelure on Pokemon that you know cannot touch it; such Pokemon include Blissey, Florges, Aromatisse, and Pokemon Choice-locked into Fire-, Fighting-, and Normal-type moves. Be wary of Toxic from these Pokemon, though, as being badly poisoned completely ruins Calm Mind Chandelure. Continue boosting until you see fit to basically OHKO the entire enemy team. Against offensive teams, use Substitute as a means to force the opponent into an aggressive move such as Dark Pulse with Hydreigon and switch out or attack accordingly.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Chandelure works great on teams as a win condition, so having support built around it is always nice. Toxic Spikes are amazing in conjunction with Substitute + Calm Mind, and Roserade just so happens to deal with bulky Water-types that can be annoying to beat in Calm Mind wars, such as Suicune. Having something to keep hazards off your side of the field is vital to Chandelure's success, so Rapid Spin users such as Mega Blastoise and Donphan and Defog users such as Crobat, Empoleon, and Mega Aerodactyl make great teammates.</p>\n"
