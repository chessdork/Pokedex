     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>After equipping an Assault Vest, Excadrill gains a massive boost to its Special Defense, granting it more opportunities to use Rapid Spin. Earthquake is still a fairly strong move despite the comparatively lower Attack investment, and it still has the ability to target Pokemon with Levitate. Iron Head and Rock Slide are Excadrill's coverage moves, and are its best options for dealing with most Ground-type resists. Shadow Claw can be used to deal more damage to bulky Ghost-types, but the lowered Attack investment and lack of a boosting item make it a subpar choice in general.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Most non-super effective special attacks will barely scratch Excadrill. While the suggested spread tries to strike a balance between offense and defense, it can always be tweaked to suit your needs. For example, an EV spread of 252 Atk / 252 Spe can grant Excadrill more of an offensive presence, while a spread consisting of 252 HP / 252 SpD with a Careful nature can make Excadrill significantly bulkier on the special side.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Assault Vest Excadrill can take on strong special attackers such as Kyurem-B, and more importantly, can Rapid Spin against foes that would ordinarily OHKO it. Against Choice Scarf Rotom-W, Excadrill would ordinarily have to choose between switching out and staying in on a potential Volt Switch. However, Rotom-W's Hydro Pump doesn't come close to OHKOing Assault Vest Excadrill, so it can use Rapid Spin regardless of what the opponent does.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Rotom-W is the quintessential Excadrill teammate, as it has an easy time switching into Excadrill's weaknesses and can take on its checks and counters. Garchomp and Tyranitar can be used to lure and take out Excadrill's checks and counters. Pokemon that appreciate the removal of Stealth Rock make for great partners as well.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Excadrill's access to Mold Breaker, good Speed, and a solid typing make it a desirable Choice Scarf user. A fast Mold Breaker Earthquake comes in handy for targeting Levitate users such as Rotom-W, Latios, and Latias, though a Choice-locked Earthquake leaves Excadrill in a vulnerable position. Iron Head and Rock Slide make up Excadrill's standard coverage moves. They're fairly weak and can be taken advantage of, but they get the job done against certain targets such as Talonflame, Thundurus, Sylveon, etc. Rapid Spin rounds out the set. While a Choice-locked Rapid Spin might sound absurd on paper, it's extremely useful for removing entry hazards against faster paced teams. Tertiary coverage moves such as X-Scissor and Brick Break are niche move options that are catered for specific threats.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>An Adamant nature is used for a significant power boost, but a Jolly nature can be used to outrun Timid Choice Scarf Heatran and +1 Jolly Gyarados, as well as Speed tie with opposing Choice Scarf Excadrill at worst.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Choice Scarf Excadrill is a top-notch utility Pokemon. It can check a variety of dangerous Pokemon such as Mega Pinsir, Talonflame, and Thundurus, sweep, as well as pull off a last ditch Rapid Spin to remove hazards. Furthermore, it's one of the best offensive checks to Thundurus due to its immunity to Thunder Wave. That said, it's rather easy to take advantage of. A Choice-locked Earthquake or weak coverage move can give your opponent an opportunity to set up or deal serious damage. With that in mind, you have to rely on prediction or its teammates to deal with Pokemon that counter Choice Scarf Excadrill.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Good partners for the Choice Scarf set are the same as for the Rapid Spin set. Rotom-W is a staple teammate for Excadrill, as it has an easy time switching into moves that Excadrill is weak to. It can also cover the Pokemon that can potentially switch in on and take advantage of Choice-locked Excadrill, such as Ground-immune Pokemon such as Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Mandibuzz. Garchomp and Tyranitar can be used to lure and take out Excadrill's checks and counters. Pokemon that appreciate the removal of Stealth Rock make for acceptable partners, though it's worth noting that Choice Scarf Excadrill is considerably less effective at removing entry hazards.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>This variant of Excadrill functions as a simple yet effective Rapid Spin user with the ability to pose as an offensive threat. Rapid Spin removes all hazards on your side of the field, and unlike Defog, it keeps the ones you may have set on your opponent's side of the field. Earthquake hits extremely hard, and is capable of hitting Levitate users such as Gengar and Rotom-W. Iron Head is a handy coverage move that's useful for damaging most Ground-type resists and is extremely effective against Fairy-types. Rock Slide grants coverage against specific Pokemon immune to Ground-type moves that take little damage from Iron Head, such as Flying-types like Thundurus and Talonflame. On the other hand, Excadrill can take advantage of its typing and offensive presence to set up Stealth Rock. Rock Slide or Shadow Claw can be used in the last slot over Stealth Rock as added coverage against specific threats (Flying- and Ghost-types). Swords Dance gives Excadrill enough power to punch through certain walls and spinblockers such as Hippowdon and Gourgeist. Toxic can be used in the final slot to get a leg up on several of the walls Pokemon that counter Excadrill, such as Mandibuzz, Landorus-T, and Hippowdon, to name a few.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Air Balloon offers Excadrill a temporary advantage against Pokemon that use Ground-type moves, while Leftovers provides residual healing. The choice of item comes down to whether you want to have a temporary immunity to Ground-type moves or consistent recovery throughout the battle. Life Orb is also a decent alternative item if Swords Dance is used. The choice of nature depends on a preference of Speed or of power. A Jolly Excadrill's ability to, at worst, Speed tie with opposing Excadrill and outspeed max Speed Rotom-W makes it more reliable, although the sheer power granted by an Adamant nature can't be understated. A bulkier spread can be used if you don't really care about Speed.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>The general idea with Excadrill is to switch in, use Rapid Spin or Stealth Rock if needed, and attack when you have an opportunity. Excadrill's excellent typing gives it plenty of opportunities to switch in and use Rapid Spin, so feel free to use Pokemon that draw in opposing Pokemon that are vulnerable it. Excadrill will generally only be able to act once per switch in, and will sometimes have to make a hard choice between using Rapid Spin, setting up Stealth Rock, and outright attacking. Using Rapid Spin is generally the best option, though the choice of move is entirely up to you. The most important thing is to avoid being predictable.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Rotom-W is a useful partner for Excadrill as it can cover most of Excadrill's weaknesses and beat most of its counters. Garchomp and Tyranitar can lure and take out Excadrill's checks and counters with their secondary sets (mixed sets from Tyranitar and Mega Garchomp, respectfully). You should make the most out of Excadrill's ability to consistently use Rapid Spin by pairing it with powerful Pokemon that are weak to Stealth Rock. Examples of these Pokemon include Mega Charizard Y (which can weaken Water-types with Drought and has great synergy with Excadrill), Mega Charizard X, Thundurus, Mega Pinsir, Dragonite, and Talonflame.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>The Speed gained from Sand Rush significantly improves Excadrill's offensive presence, improving its ability to revenge kill or possibly even sweep. Adamant Excadrill's Life Orb-boosted Earthquake hits hard; with a bit of prior damage, it is capable of taking down most Pokemon in a single strike. The effectiveness of Iron Head and Rock Slide as coverage moves is noticeably enhanced by the Life Orb boost. In particular, Excadrill is capable of 3HKOing Mandibuzz with Life Orb (which is relevant if Rock Slide flinches Mandibuzz). The last slot determines how this set is played. If Swords Dance is used, Excadrill gains the ability to break through sturdier Pokemon such as Mandibuzz and sweep entire teams outright. On the other hand, if Rapid Spin is used, it can provide the team with semi-consistent anti-entry hazard support in addition to functioning as a top-notch attacker/revenge killer.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>While Adamant is the primary nature for its sheer power boost, Jolly can be used to ensure that Excadrill at least Speed ties with opposing Sand Rush Excadrill and outspeeds max Speed base 80 Speed Pokemon outside of sand. A bulkier spread can be used if you're only concerned with outspeeding walls without sand support, as Sand Rush Excadrill with even minimal Speed investment outspeeds virtually the entire metagame.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>A Sand Stream user equipped with a Smooth Rock is practically a must, as five turns aren't enough for Excadrill to sweep. After setting up sandstorm, it's imperative to bring in Excadrill as early as possible to maximize the amount of time Sand Rush is active. However, don't make the mistake of playing recklessly; if your opponent has a strong Excadrill counter and you don't need to use Rapid Spin, it's best to keep Excadrill away from battle, even if it means wasting turns that sand is in play. This variant of Excadrill can be used as a revenge killer or late-game sweeper depending on the state of the match. Swords Dance Excadrill should look for a setup opportunity to break walls or cores. That said, until you find a clear opportunity to set up, it's best to just attack whenever possible, as Life Orb-boosted Earthquakes deal significant damage. Attacking on the switch to weaken checks is also encouraged. Rapid Spin Excadrill should be played as an offensive threat with the ability to spin away entry hazards when the opportunity presents itself. It's best to keep attacking for the most part unless your opponent has a Pokemon that completely counters Excadrill.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Sand Stream users such as Tyranitar and Hippowdon that are equipped with Smooth Rock are strongly recommended as partners for Excadrill. Tyranitar and Hippowdon have the distinction of being durable, making it easier to bring back sand when it runs out. As always, Rotom-W is an excellent partner due to its fantastic defensive synergy with Excadrill and its ability to safely bring Excadrill into battle with Volt Switch. Landorus is a solid offensive partner, as it shares certain checks and counters with Excadrill, meaning that they can weaken each other's checks and counters.</p>\n"
