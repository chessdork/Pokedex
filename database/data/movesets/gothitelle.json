     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Gothitelle's chosen Psychic-type STAB attack allows it to deal heavy damage to or OHKO several popular offensive and defensive threats in the metagame, including Mega Venusaur, Assault Vest Conkeldurr, and Keldeo locked into Secret Sword. It is also Gothitelle's most powerful move, making it a decent choice against most threats that don't resist Psychic. Both have their own benefits: Psyshock OHKOes Assault Vest Conkeldurr and does more damage to special walls such as Blissey, Sylveon, and Goodra, while Psychic can KO Mega Venusaur with less prior damage, and is generally more powerful. Thunderbolt's primary targets are Skarmory, Mandibuzz, and Gyarados, but it also a great option for the likes of Togekiss, Azumarill, and Politoed. Hidden Power Fire is used mainly to hit Ferrothorn and (Mega) Scizor, and is guaranteed to OHKO physically defensive variants of both with Stealth Rock damage. Energy Ball is an alternative option to hit Quagsire, Gastrodon, Hippowdon, and Rotom-W, all of which also tend to be important parts of defensive cores. Grass Knot can take Energy Ball's place for a guaranteed OHKO on Hippowdon as well as a harder hit on Tyranitar, but it does pittance to Rotom-W due to its low weight. Trick is the icing on the cake, allowing Gothitelle to instantly and severely cripple defensive tanks and walls, such as Chansey, Clefable, Porygon2, and Snorlax. It should be noted that unlike other Trick users, Gothitelle can be selective in targets it can use Trick on, so it doesn't have to worry about Pokemon with Mega Stones switching in.</p>\n<p>Gothitelle isn't necessarily limited to the moves listed above; you can choose other moves and tailor your moveset depending on which threats your team has trouble with. Hidden Power Ice is an option for instantly OHKOing Gliscor, Garchomp, and Landorus-T, though Gothitelle might have trouble switching into these three for various reasons. Hidden Power Ground is used specifically for Heatran, but can also put a decent dent in Tyranitar and Bisharp when needed. Notably, when running a combination of Hidden Power Ground, Psychic, and Trick, Gothitelle can defeat and cripple the common stall core of Mega Venusaur, Heatran, and Chansey.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The item of choice for this set, of course, is Choice Specs, which gives Gothitelle the power to break through defensive cores and Pokemon. With Trick, it also operates as a nasty afterthought to item-reliant walls and tanks. While Gothitelle isn't exactly fast enough to outrun a majority of threats, maximized Special Attack and Speed are recommended so it stands a better chance of beating opponents that typically don't invest in their Speed, especially (Mega) Scizor, Rotom-W, Heatran, Mega Venusaur and Landorus-T. Modest nature is also recommended as Gothitelle requires the extra power and doesn't outrun anything particularly relevant with Timid aside from max Speed Adamant Breloom and Bisharp.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, Gothitelle can invest in its bulk to better take hits at the cost of a higher chance of beating several faster threats. In this case, an EV spread of 212 HP / 252 SpA / 44 Spe can be used to outspeed minimum Speed Skarmory and Politoed while investing the rest of the EVs in HP for extra bulk.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>The main goal of this set is to trap and eliminate Pokemon in defensive cores to allow a sweeper to sweep after they have been removed. Notably, Gothitelle performs exceptionally well against stall teams, as it can cripple and dismantle multiple defensive Pokemon repeatedly without taking too much damage. As long as you can keep Gothitelle from taking too much chip damage, expect it to take down at least a couple of threats on stall teams. Playing with Gothitelle doesn't require much prediction, as the foe can't switch out. However, bear in mind that the opponent may be able to take advantage of the move at you will be locked into. To trap and KO successfully, Gothitelle must be at a reasonable level of health, especially when operating against hard-hitting or faster opponents. A good way to do this is by means of U-turn and Volt Switch, or after one of your Pokemon has fainted. Bringing it in on attacks is not recommended, especially physical or boosted ones, unless resisted.</p>\n<p>Gothitelle itself has good, but modest, overall bulk, so it can afford to take hits on both sides occasionally. The sight of Gothitelle in team preview could also lead the opponent to making strange double switches to avoid being trapped. This is easy to take advantage of, but be aware that you can also fall victim to bad switches. Also, trapping anything while the other team has a Pursuit user such as Bisharp or Tyranitar is not recommended, as they will be able to KO Gothitelle back straightaway. The exception to this is if the Pokemon in your way is a huge threat to your team, and after it is gone things will be significantly easier for your win condition, so Gothitelle is not as necessary after it has taken down its important foe.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Keep in mind that Gothitelle is purely a supporting attacker, so it doesn't actually need much support on its own. However, Gothitelle prefers switching in on its targets cleanly, making Volt Switch and U-turn very helpful, if not required. Examples of teammates that can use these moves include (Mega) Scizor, Rotom-W, Landorus-T, and Thundurus, all of which have counters that can be immediately eliminated by Gothitelle. Rapid Spin and Defog are also helpful in ensuring Gothitelle can switch in cleanly, although keep in mind that when using Defog your own sweepers might require previously-set entry hazards. Latios, Latias, and Excadrill are good choices for this. Sticky Web is also optimal, as it allows Gothitelle to trap and KO a wider range of threats more efficiently without taking too much damage in the process. Shuckle and Smeargle are good choices for this, but perform differently from each other, so the choice is dependent on your team.</p>\n<p>Many offensive Pokemon in particular benefit from Gothitelle's trapping abilities. For instance, Thundurus often has trouble with Chansey, Hippowdon, and Quagsire depending on which set it's using; all three are easy pickings for Gothitelle thanks to Trick and its chosen Grass-type move. Gothitelle is also efficient at getting rid of Mega Venusaur, so Tail Glow Manaphy not only appreciates Gothitelle as a teammate, but also gains the freedom to use Energy Ball rather than Psychic. Gothitelle can also dismantle Quagsire, Hippowdon, and Skarmory easily, allowing it to work well with physical setup sweepers. Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X, Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar, Swords Dance Mega Pinsir, and Swords Dance Bisharp are just a few of many exceptional physical sweepers that perform well after said walls are eliminated. Finally, Gothitelle appreciates teammates that can threaten or set up on Pursuit users after it faints. Terrakion, Keldeo, and Greninja are just a few examples of threats that can match up decently against common Pursuit users.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Psychic gets the 2HKO on Mega Scizor at +6, is stronger than Psyshock in general, and can also drop the opponent's Special Defense, meaning that it is still possible to win against extremely bulky targets that resist Psychic. However, Psyshock helps with Ho-Oh and lets Gothitelle set up alongside and beat Calm Mind Arceus formes easily. Calm Mind allows Gothitelle to set up on weaker, specially attacking Pokemon&mdash;support Arceus formes in particular&mdash;freely boost, and then destroy the opponent. Rest lets Gothitelle shrug off status and gather extra boosts whilst fully recovering its health. Trick Room lets Gothitelle take advantage of its mediocre Speed after getting to +6, allowing it to potentially sweep through whole teams that don't have a Dark-type. It also gives Gothitelle some use against Hyper Offensive teams, as it can sometimes survive certain strong hits such as Xerneas's +2 Moonblast or Zekrom's Bolt Strike and sacrifice itself to set up Trick Room and ruin the opponent's momentum completely. Taunt harrasses walls and can delay Defog, Roar/Whirlwind as well as preventing opposing boosting moves. Reflect can be used to patch Gothitelle's fragile Defense and cushion Pursuit. Heal Bell can be used to support your team in a status heavy metagame like Ubers, and Gothitelle does not have to worry about being taken advantage of whilst using it. Magic Coat can be used to surprise Taunt users and hazard setters.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Maximum special bulk lets Gothitelle set up safely on targets such as Palkia or Scarf Xerneas if Gothitelle can come in for free. If using Trick Room, run minimum Speed so that Gothitelle is as slow possible when Trick Room is active. If using Taunt, opt for a Calm nature and 44 Speed EVs to outrun Skarmory before it can Taunt you or set up entry hazards, or opt for Timid with enough Speed to outrun maximum Speed Arceus under Sticky Web. If you want to move some Special Defense EVs elsewhere, you can choose to run only 40 Special Defense EVs, the minimum required to be able to switch in and set up on support Arceus, with a Calm or Sassy nature and pour the rest into the stat of your choice.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>The list of targets that Gothitelle can trap is huge. Arceus-Water, -Grass, -Fairy, -Rock, Palkia (without Lustrous Orb or rain), Dialga, Scarf Xerneas, Scarf Kyogre locked into Ice Beam or Thunder, special attacking Dragons at -2 after Draco Meteor, Specs users locked into unfavourable moves, and even more. Don't overestimate its bulk, however, as special attackers such as Lustrous Orb Palkia hit too hard for Gothitelle to switch in directly. Wait for the target to KO a weakened or otherwise unimportant team member so that Gothitelle can come in perfectly healthy. Also, watch out for phazing moves like Roar or Dragon Tail from the likes of Palkia and Dialga, as well as Punishment from support Arceus. Double switching is another way to get Gothitelle in healthy, although it is much riskier and reliant on you properly reading your opponent's plays.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind Shadow Tag is supposed to crack open defensive cores so that the rest of your team can sweep or clean up the opponent. Just because Gothitelle uses Calm Mind doesn't mean you should hold it back until it can sweep. It is also possible for Gothitelle to come in, trap something, kill it, then get out and come back in later to do the same thing. If you are using Gothitelle on a Sticky Web team, acknowledge that it is very hard to safely keep support Arceus under permanent Taunt to prevent Defog, so you will have to find a way to replace the lost webs. Trick Room can help in that respect, but it is also smart to keep your Webs setter around.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Gothitelle can be paired off with literally any offensive threat that appreciates the removal of its checks and counters. Some major examples are Yveltal and Palkia appreciating the removal of Arceus-Fairy, defensive Xerneas, and other defensive Fairies; Kyogre appreciating the removal of Palkia, Arceus-Water, and Arceus-Grass; Ho-Oh appreciating the removal of Arceus-Rock and Arceus-Water; Arceus-Normal and Mega Kangaskhan appreciating the removal of Will-O-Wisp support Arceus; and Xerneas appreciating the removal of Klefki.</p>\n<p>Gothitelle particularly excels at removing support Arceus formes, which are often the defensive backbones for teams. Fake Out Mega Kangaskhan also excels against the team archetype that Gothitelle struggles with: hyper offensive teams. Teams that heavily rely on entry hazards also appreciate Gothitelle's ability to easily trap support Arceus, which are the most common Defog users in the tier. Gothitelle can also trap Palkia, making Choice Scarf Kyogre a powerful partner and potential cleaning option. Another option is trapping the opposing team's cleric and getting rid of it so that you can freely cripple everything with status.</p>\n<p>If you want to increase the odds of Gothitelle sweeping, teammates like Arceus-Ghost can help put pressure on Dark-types like Yveltal and Darkrai by burning them or forcing them to sacrifice themselves to remove Arceus. Burning any potential Pursuit users means that Gothitelle can safely escape from them instead of being trapped.</p>\n"
