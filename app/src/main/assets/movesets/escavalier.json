     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Escavalier makes an ideal user of Assault Vest. It has a whopping base 135 Attack stat, and its defensive typing leaves it susceptible to only one type. Megahorn is the Bug-type STAB move of choice, as it deals massive damage to anything that does not resist it. Iron Head has great neutral coverage alongside Megahorn and serves as the secondary STAB attack. Knock Off allows Escavalier to remove items such as Leftovers or Eviolite, and hits Ghost-type Pokemon such as Chandelure that might try to switch into its STAB moves. The last move is a bit of a toss up. Drill Run provides excellent coverage for hitting the Fire-type Pokemon that would otherwise take pitiful damage from Escavalier's attacks. However, Pursuit allows it to trap opponents and is a great option nonetheless, as Fire-types like Victini are hit hard by Knock Off on the switch as it is, and others like Houndoom are dented by Megahorn on the switch as well.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The given EVs allow Escavalier to hit as hard as possible while also allowing Escavalier to outspeed the likes of Slowking, Calm Mind Reuniclus, and Snorlax, and an Adamant nature maximizes Escavalier's damage output. An Assault Vest makes Escavalier a very good tank, boosting its Special Defense at the cost of only being able to use damaging moves. The ability Overcoat should be used, as it has been buffed to allow Escavalier to switch in on Pokemon that have access to powder-based moves, such as Sleep Powder Roserade, and force them out with its powerful attacks.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Do not stay in against Fire-type Pokemon; they will literally roast Escavalier. Also, try not to let Escavalier get burned, as it will halve its Attack and cripple it throughout the match. Remember, Escavalier is worn down easily because it has no reliable recovery, so keep that in mind when continuously switching into attacks.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Escavalier appreciates Wish support, as it has no options for recovery. Good partners include Florges or Umbreon because they both have access to Wish, as well as Aromatherapy and Heal Bell, respectively. Florges especially has great type synergy with Escavalier. Rapid Spin or Defog support is also appreciated, as Escavalier gets worn down easily. Ironically, Fire-types are ideal partners. Since Escavalier naturally lures in Fire-type attacks, Pokemon such as Houndoom and Chandelure can switch in and get a Flash Fire boost. Water-types are also good partners, especially Blastoise or Tentacruel, which can provide Rapid Spin support, which is vital to preserve Escavalier's longevity, as mentioned previously. Paralysis or Trick Room support can also help with Escavalier's Speed issue. Status absorbers are also helpful, as Escavalier is crippled by burns.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Megahorn is Escavalier's strongest STAB move, allowing it to deal massive damage to Pokemon such as Cresselia and Tyranitar. Since Megahorn is Escavalier's most powerful STAB move, it's the move that Escavalier will be using the most against the opponent. Iron Head provides an accurate secondary STAB move for Escavalier and, while not as powerful as Megahorn, it hits Fairy-type Pokemon such as Aromatisse and Sylveon for super effective damage. It also has a 30% chance to flinch the opponent, completely shutting them down for that turn. Knock Off is a great move on Escavalier, as it provides good coverage, while also being able to hit Ghost-types such as Jellicent and Chandelure for super effective damage. Knock Off also removes the opposing Pokemon's item, which can cripple them for the rest of the match. Drill Run rounds out Escavalier's coverage, allowing it to hit Fire-, Steel-, and Poison-type Pokemon, such as Heatran, Excadrill, and Klefki, for super effective damage.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Assault Vest is the item of choice, as it boosts Escavalier's Special Defense to astounding levels. Overcoat is one of Escavalier's best traits, as it allows Escavalier to switch into common Pokemon with sleep-inducing moves such as Breloom, Amoonguss, and Jumpluff with ease. The EV spread allows Escavalier to take as many hits as possible while also allowing it to dish out heavy damage. A Brave nature and 0 Speed IVs allow Escavalier to be as slow as possible under Trick Room, while also giving it as much power as possible.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>As previously mentioned, Spore and Sleep Powder users can't put Escavalier to sleep due to Overcoat, making it a great switch-in to users of these moves. Assault Vest gives Escavalier excellent special bulk, making it an amazing offensive pivot. It also allows Escavalier to switch into special attackers such as Cresselia, Shaymin-S, Ludicolo, Latios, and Gardevoir and threaten them out with its STAB moves. Trick Room helps Escavalier immensely, allowing it to outspeed nearly every Pokemon in the game. Fire-types can be a problem for Escavalier, so make sure you know how to play around them. Predicting a Fire-type switch-in and going for Drill Run, as well as smart double switching to wear down an opposing Charizard, are some good tactics for dealing with these Pokemon. Finally, due to Assault Vest preventing Escavalier from running non-damaging moves, Escavalier can find itself getting double targeted quite easily due to its inability to run Protect.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Trick Room users such as Cresselia, Jellicent, and Dusclops, are some of the best partners for Escavalier, as they allow Escavalier to outspeed and deal massive damage to almost every Pokemon in the game. Cresselia is especially helpful, as it has access to Safeguard to protect Escavalier from burns, as well as Ice Beam and Psyshock for hitting Intimidate users such as Landorus-T and Hitmontop. Pokemon such as Heatran, Tyranitar, and Politoed can absorb Fire-type moves for Escavalier, and the latter two can also change the weather if sun is up. Politoed's rain weakens the power of Fire-type moves for Escavalier, making it a very helpful teammate. Expert Belt Cresselia, Bisharp, Azumarill, and Shaymin-S can all help eliminate some of the more common Intimidate users, such as Hitmontop and Landorus-T. Shaymin-S can also OHKO Rotom-W before it can use Will-O-Wisp on Escavalier. Intimidate users such as Landorus-T, Hitmontop, Scrafty, and Gyarados can help patch up Escavalier's weaker Defense stat. They are also great switch-ins to one of Escavalier's biggest counters, Heatran. Finally, Choice Scarf Rotom-W, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, Terrakion, and Thundurus can all outspeed and KO Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y and Gyarados, making them great partners.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Megahorn is Escavalier's strongest STAB move, and it hits very hard off of Escavalier's high Attack stat. Iron Head is its secondary STAB move and has decent coverage with Megahorn, hitting the Rock-types as well as the Fairy-types that resist Megahorn. Knock Off hits Ghost- and Psychic-types very hard and has good utility in removing the opponent's held item. Drill Run is Escavalier's only method of hitting Steel- and Fire-types hard, especially Emboar and Cobalion as they resist its STAB moves. Pursuit, on the other hand, is very useful for trapping and eliminating Ghost- and Psychic-types.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>An Adamant nature and 252 Attack EVs ensure that Escavalier hits as hard as possible. 84 Speed EVs allow Escavalier to outspeed minimum Speed base 30s such as Slowking. The remaining EVs are invested into HP to enhance Escavalier's bulk. Assault Vest turns Escavalier into a very potent special tank; with an Assault Vest, Escavalier can take a Fire Blast from maximum Special Attack Slowking from full health. Overcoat makes Escavalier immune to Spore, Sleep Powder, and other powder-based moves, as well as hail damage. A Brave nature with 0 Speed EVs and IVs should be used if Escavalier is being used on a Trick Room team.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This set fits best on bulky offense and balanced teams that are looking for a special tank with a strong offensive presence. Bear in mind that Assault Vest Escavalier is not a wall. Use it to pivot into resisted or weak special hits and hit back hard. Escavalier should be spamming Knock Off early-game as it cripples its usual switch-ins. Speaking of Knock Off, be wary of opposing Knock Off users, as the loss of Assault Vest severely reduces Escavalier's tanking capabilities. Don't keep Escavalier on anything that could possibly burn it. Although Escavalier can take some weak non-STAB Fire-type moves, don't push your luck, as Escavalier can't take Moltres's or Delphox's Fire Blast.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>A teammate to take on Fire-types is a must. Bulky Water-types such as Alomomola and Slowking are good options. The former can keep Escavalier healthy with Wish while the latter can set up Trick Room for Escavalier. They also appreciate the pressure Escavalier puts on opposing Grass-types. A burn is highly detrimental for Escavalier, so a cleric is also a great teammate. Aromatisse can provide Aromatherapy support and has access to Wish, while also having good synergy with Escavalier. Druddigon can threaten opposing Fire-types and can also set up Stealth Rock. In return, Escavalier can take care of Fairy- and Ice-types. Due to having to switch constantly, Escavalier can be worn down by entry hazards easily. Because of this, it appreciates teammates which can use Rapid Spin or Defog. Hitmonlee is a good option as it can also threaten Steel-types which resist Escavalier's STAB moves. In return, Escavalier can trap opposing Ghost- and Psychic-types with Pursuit so that Hitmonlee can freely use High Jump Kick. Kabutops is also a good option as it can take care of Fire-types, and in return, Escavalier can take on Grass-types. Escavalier forces a lot of switches, so Spikes users such as Omastar and defensive Qwilfish are good teammates.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>It's not hard to see why one would equip a Choice Band on a Pokemon like Escavalier. Its Attack stat is boosted to extreme levels, and with a high Base Power move in Megahorn, Escavalier will rip many teams apart. Megahorn deals massive damage to anything that does not resist it. Iron Head is a decent secondary STAB move with good coverage alongside Megahorn. Drill Run allows Escavalier to hit the Fire- and Steel-type Pokemon that can otherwise switch into it. Alternatively, Pursuit can also used to trap many opposing Pokemon. Knock Off removes items and is helpful when facing stall-based teams.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Maximizing Attack allows Escavalier to hit as hard as possible with a Choice Band. The given HP EVs allow Escavalier to tank more hits and switch more times into Stealth Rock, and the 84 Speed EVs allows Escavalier to outspeed Pokemon such as Snorlax. The ability Overcoat should be used because it makes Escavalier immune to powder-based moves.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Do not stay in against incoming Fire-type moves, and also try not to stay in against Scald, which runs the risk of inflicting a burn. Take advantage of opposing Grass-, Fairy-, or Bug-type Pokemon that cannot harm Escavalier, and start punching holes through teams. Also do your best to predict well, as Escavalier will be locked into a move because of Choice Band.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Rapid Spin or Defog support is greatly appreciated, as they help with Escavalier's longevity. Blastoise makes a solid partner, as it resists Fire-type attacks and can use Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards. Fire-type resistant Pokemon make excellent partners, as they can take the Fire-type moves aimed at Escavalier. Chandelure and Houndoom make excellent offensive partners, as they can absorb Fire-type attacks and get a Flash Fire boost from them in the process. Cleric support is appreciated to allow Escavalier to stay healthy throughout the match. Paralysis support is helpful because Escavalier is too slow to sweep. Trick Room is another option that may be useful as it lets slower Pokemon move first, but is gimmicky. Status absorbers such as Guts Machamp make great partners.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Megahorn is Escavalier's strongest STAB move. Choice Band Escavalier 2HKOs Alomomola and OHKOs Tangrowth with Megahorn. Iron Head is the secondary STAB move of choice, hitting Fairies and Rock-types very hard. Knock Off hits Jellicent and Doublade, and it has the added benefit of removing the opposing Pokemon's item. Drill Run is Escavalier's only method of hitting Emboar, Cobalion, and Registeel for heavy damage. Pursuit, on the other hand, is very useful for trapping and eliminating Ghost- and Psychic-types.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>252 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature provide Escavalier with as much power as possible. The Speed EVs allow Escavalier to outspeed minimum Speed base 30s. The rest of the EVs are put in HP to enhance its bulk. Choice Band gives this set immense wallbreaking capabilities. Overcoat gives Escavalier an immunity to powder-based moves, allowing it to switch into Spore and Sleep Powder. A Brave nature with 0 Speed EVs and IVs should be used if Escavalier is being used on a Trick Room team.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This Escavalier set fits on bulky offense teams which need an immensely powerful tank and wallbreaker. Use it as a hole-puncher early- to mid-game, so that one of its teammates can clean later. Bring it in on resisted attacks and use Megahorn, unless the opposing team has a bulky Pokemon resistant to Bug. Knock Off is also a very spammable move and cripples Escavalier's usual switch-ins by removing their items as well as chipping away at their health. Drill Run, although useful for hitting Steel- and Fire-types, is a bad move to be locked into, so use it sensibly. Don't let Escavalier take too much damage, or it will go down really fast. Scout for Fire-type moves on the Pokemon that can be usually countered by Escavalier such as Hidden Power Fire on Tangrowth and Amoonguss.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Pokemon that can take on Fire-types are good teammates for Escavalier. Bulky Water-types such as Alomomola and Slowking are good options. They can also support Escavalier with Trick Room and Wish, respectively. Aromatisse can provide cleric support with Aromatherapy and also has access to Wish, as well as having good synergy with Escavalier. Escavalier appreciates teammates which can use Rapid Spin or Defog. Hitmonlee is a good option as it can also threaten Steel-types which resist Escavalier's main STAB moves. In return, Escavalier can trap opposing Ghost- and Psychic-types with Pursuit, so that Hitmonlee can freely use High Jump Kick. Kabutops is also a good option as it can take care of Fire-types, and in return, Escavalier can take on Grass-types. Escavalier forces a lot of switches, so Spikes users such as Omastar are good teammates. Escavalier can punch holes in the opposing team, allowing a teammate to sweep late-game. Sharpedo is a good option, as it appreciates the removal of Tangrowth and Alomomola.</p>\n"
