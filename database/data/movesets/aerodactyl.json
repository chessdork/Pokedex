     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Mega Aerodactyl is the fastest unboosted user of Rock Slide in VGC 2014, which means just about anything your opponent can have will risk getting flinched if Mega Aerodactyl uses Rock Slide. Because Rock Slide also receives a boost from STAB and Mega Aerodactyl's base 135 Attack stat, the damage output is not bad at all, even with minimal Attack investment. STAB Rock Slide also makes Mega Aerodactyl Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y's biggest threat as it resists Gale Wings Brave Bird from Talonflame, outpaces both of them, and OHKOes both of them with a single hit, not to mention their partner will likely flinch. Mega Aerodactyl's Speed and Tough Claws-boosted Sky Drop make it a terror to face when paired with a set up sweeper or a powerful Pokemon that needs an opponent put out of play for a turn. Also, it eases prediction when targeting the Pokemon that Mega Aerodactyl has picked up since it cannot Protect on the turn it falls. Similarly, Mega Aerodactyl cannot use Protect when using Sky Drop on the opponent either and, unlike its support set, does not have a Focus Sash to save it from a potential KO on its way down. So, use Sky Drop conservatively. Roost is used to increase Mega Aerodactyl's longevity so it can keep flinch fishing with Rock Slide or supporting its teammates with Sky Drop. Roost makes Mega Aerodactyl a much larger pain to face in general. Protect is to give Mega Aerodactyl's partner a turn to KO or cripple Mega Aerodactyl's check or counter as well as being usefun in many situations. Taunt can be used to help Mega Aerodactyl against Smeargle and Amoonguss, and make them useless. Tailwind is an fantastic Speed control move that a good amount of teams are based around. Wide Guard can save many of Mega Aerodactyl's teammates from the multitude of spread moves that are used.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The EVs are rather specific in that they allow Mega Aerodactyl to sponge a Choice Specs Thunderbolt from Rotom-A formes while in Sandstorm. It is also able to survive a critical hit Stone Edge from a Salamence with a hindering Attack nature. The Speed investment is used to outrun Talonflame before Mega Evolving and to outrun base 80 Speed Pokemon with a Choice Scarf, namely Rotom-A and Gardevoir, after. Unnerve has elevated priority when announcing itself, so Pressure is used instead to scout for Choice Scarf Gardevoir and Salamence before Aerodactyl Mega Evolves. Unnerve is also useless since it will become Tough Claws after Aerodactyl Mega Evolves anyways.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Mega Aerodactyl has potential staying power, so make use of this staying power by using Roost and Protect at the correct times. Make sure that Mega Aerodactyl is in a Sandstorm when it is out as the Special Defense boost from Sandstorm is extremely noticeable and can save Mega Aerodactyl a lot of the time. When using Sky Drop, be sure to have planned out how you are going to keep Mega Aerodactyl safe when it drops the opponent since it predictably cannot use Protect this turn. Similarly, use the turn that an opponent is dropped to your advantage since the opponent cannot use Protect that turn either, leaving them open to a potential KO. This can also save Mega Aerodactyl if the opponent in question had the ability to KO it. Burns take a good chunk out of Mega Aerodactyl's survivability, especially when using Sky Drop, while also weakening it its two attacking moves. Keeping burns away from Mega Aerodactyl is pretty important, especially in a format full of Will-O-Wisp users. When Mega Aerodactyl has done its job and is left with nothing to do, it can always fish for Rock Slide flinches.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Sand Stream is always needed when using Mega Aerodactyl in order to ensure that it gets the most out of its bulk investment. This makes Hippowdon and Tyranitar very good partners despite the weaknesses they share with Mega Aerodactyl. However, Amoonguss and Ferrothorn can help cover these weaknesses while also dealing with Mega Aerodactyl's most common counter: Rotom-W. Pokemon that require set up and powerful attackers enjoy Mega Aerodactyl's consistent Sky Drop support and the occasional flinch from Rock Slide. Hydreigon, Aegislash, Gyarados, Scrafty, Bisharp and many more fall under this category.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Stone Edge is a powerful STAB move, and, although it's not boosted by Tough Claws, it hits quite hard. Earthquake completes the infamous EdgeQuake combo and gets nearly flawless coverage. Fire Fang is also very helpful because it's boosted by Tough Claws and hits Steel-types, while also hitting Skarmory. Ice Fang is further boosted by Tough Claws and is important to hit Landorus and Garchomp, while also hitting Hippowdon for decent damage. Aerial Ace is another STAB move boosted by Tough Claws; it also hits Mega Venusaur and gets decent coverage all around. Aqua Tail isn't listed but is certainly a viable option to hit Hippowdon harder than Ice Fang; however, Ice Fang gets much better coverage all-around and specifically hits Garchomp very hard. Hone Claws is Mega Aerodactyl's only way to boost Attack, but the result is somewhat subpar compared to what other setup sweepers such as Azumarill can do. Stealth Rock is another option because it provides support for its team and wears down potential switch-ins, although this is better left to a teammate.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The EV spread maximizes Mega Aerodactyl's power and Speed while avoiding the 2HKO from Talonflame's Choice Band-boosted Brave Bird. The Speed EVs can be readjusted to outspeed certain Pokemon as well; for example, with 176 Speed EVs, Mega Aerodactyl can outspeed max Speed Greninja after Mega Evolving and invest more in bulk. Adamant nature increases Mega Aerodactyl's damage output, while Jolly doesn't allow Mega Aerodactyl to outspeed anything notable. Aerodactylite is used over a Life Orb or a Choice Band to allow Aerodactyl to Mega Evolve and gain Tough Claws, Speed, bulk, and a lot more benefits than other items provide.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>It is best to Mega Evolve as soon as possible, to gain bulk and Speed. This is important because it can be outsped by quite a bit before Mega Evolution, so be cautious! Using coverage moves when it is super effective is a given, and this set has plenty of coverage moves to hit the vast majority of OU with. This set plays fairly simply, and there's not much to explain: attack when appropriate is the main objective of this set. Prediction is also a key factor for this set, as if a Pokemon can correctly predict what move Mega Aerodactyl will use, the opponent can gain a free switch-in to a potential check or counter. Mega Aerodactyl can be used either early-game or late-game. When used early-game, it should focus on wearing down offensive teams so a teammate can sweep a bit later in the match, while it can clean up late-game if its partners have worn down bulkier Pokemon. Also, do note that thanks to Mega Aerodactyl's naturally high Speed, it can revenge kill some slower Scarfers.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>As mentioned previously, Rapid Spin or Defog support is needed, making Latios and Excadrill good partners. Keldeo offers nice synergy and can break through Hippowdon with ease. Landorus is another wallbreaker that greatly helps by breaking down bulkier teams. Klefki is an interesting partner that gets great synergy with Aerodactyl, can set Spikes to wear down switch-ins, and paralyzes Choice Scarf users threatening to revenge kill Mega Aerodactyl. Hazard support, in general, is very useful to wear down bulkier Pokemon and other switch-ins, making Tyranitar and Ferrothorn good partners as well. Hippowdon offers good synergy and provides Sand, which wears down the opponent slowly and boosts Mega Aerodactyl's Special Defense.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Rock Slide and Sky Drop are probably Aerodactyl's two best options for a support set. Aerodactyl's extremely high Speed stat means that Rock Slide will usually go before your opponents two Pokemon, making full use of Rock Slide's nasty flinch chance. Rock Slide also allows Aerodactyl to check Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, and other weakened Pokemon that have a weakness to it. Sky Drop is an extremely irritating STAB move that gives Aerodactyl's partner a free one on one match up for a turn. Tailwind is one of the best Speed control moves in the game. Aerodactyl is a very reliable user of the move thanks to its already ridiculous Speed stat and its Focus Sash. The Speed increase Aerodactyl receives from Tailwind also makes Rock Slide flinch fishing more potent. Protect is to block the annoying Fake Out that is used often in VGC 2014 so that Aerodactyl's Focus Sash is not broken before it can even move. The ability to Protect Aerodactyl for a turn is also very useful in many situations. Wide Guard is a supportive move that keeps Aerodactyl and its teammate safe from spread moves like Rock Slide, Surf, Earthquake and Discharge. Taunt makes Pokemon like Smeargle and Amoonguss next to useless and stops Trick Room setters from ruining Aerodactyl's potential Tailwind. Ice Fang is a neat coverage move to punish Salamence and Garchomp leads while also bringing Noivern down to its Focus Sash. Note that Aerodactyl's Focus Sash will likely be broken if it hits a Garchomp with Ice Fang.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The EVs are very straightforward in that they allow Aerodactyl to Speed tie with other Aerodactyl and Mega Gengar while also outspeeding everything below base 130 Speed, besides Choice Scarf users. The Attack investment is to make sure Aerodactyl will be hitting as hard as possible without a positive nature. Unnerve is a useful supporting ability that stops the consumption of common berries such as Sitrus and Lum Berry. However, Unnerve always goes first when announcing itself, so if you would rather scout for a Choice Scarf on Salamence or Gardevoir, then Pressure is preferred. A bulkier spread of 252 HP / 44 Atk / 212 Spe can be used if you wish to use your Focus Sash elsewhere on your team, but the Focus Sash variant is generally preferred.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>When against Fake Out users, the safest play on the first turn is to Protect Aerodactyl and its partner if either of them are carrying it. This ensures your Focus Sash will remain intact for the turn you use Tailwind, Sky Drop, or Rock Slide. Note that Aerodactyl is hardly ever dead weight due to its ability to flinch opponents with Rock Slide and the support Sky Drop provides. Knowing this, don't play Aerodactyl recklessly if you don't need to. Use Sky Drop to give Aerodactyl's partner a free turn with an opponent that cannot do too much to it. This is extremely useful for set up sweepers since it removes the threat of a double target for a turn. It should be noted that Aerodactyl cannot use Sky Drop on Pokemon weighing over 200 kg. Gyarados and Rhyperior are Pokemon that come to mind in this weight bracket, although Aerodactyl should not stay in on Rhyperior and use Rock Slide on Gyarados. Sky Drop can also end Aerodactyl since it cannot Protect itself when dropping the opponent, so use the move wisely. Tailwind should be used only when needed since it only lasts three turns after it is set up. With that said, Aerodactyl should be saved until it is needed to set up Tailwind as the move allows many slower attackers to easily get the upper hand on their otherwise faster checks. If Aerodactyl is up against Trick Room without Taunt, it is generally in your best interest to leave Aerodactyl behind for the match due to Aerodactyl's naturally high Speed and Trick Room making Tailwind a monstrous backfire if used. If you do have Taunt though, feel free to Taunt any Trick Room setter that isn't an Aromatisse, as long as there are no Fake Out users along side the Trick Room user.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Any slow attacker is a good partner for Aerodactyl due to its ability to use Tailwind, put an opponent out of play for a turn, and occasionally allow its partner to live another turn with a Rock Slide flinch. Bisharp and Kangaskhan are two perfect examples of beneficiaries from Aerodactyl's support abilities. Bisharp not only benefits greatly from the Tailwind Aerodactyl provides, but Assurance also turns into a 120 Base Power STAB move when an opponent is hit by Aerodactyl's Rock Slide first. Mega Kangaskhan isn't exactly slow, but it still greatly benefits from Tailwind, while it also enjoys the turn to Power-Up Punch while not fearing a double target due to Sky Drop. Sky Drop can give Pokemon like Mega Charizard X, Gyarados, Mega Gyarados, Dragon Dance Scrafty, and Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar a much needed opportunity to set up. If EVed correctly, these Pokemon can KO their respective checks after setting up the same turn as Aerodactyl drops said check. Beneficiaries from Wide Guard include Mega Charizard Y and Aegislash as both of them are commonly targeted by spread moves. Both of them greatly appreciate Tailwind support.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Taunt is the main focus of this set and allows Aerodactyl to shut down many defensive threats, such as Chansey, that rely on status moves; it also prevents these threats from recovering health. Taunt also allows Mega Aerodactyl to beat threats it normally can't, such as Skarmory, Mew, and Hippowdon lacking Stone Edge. Aerial Ace hits Mega Medicham, Mega Heracross, and Keldeo super effectively. Running Aerial Ace ensures that Mega Aerodactyl can beat Grass-types that would otherwise wall it, such as Amoonguss, Mega Venusaur, and Breloom, and allows it to revenge kill Keldeo as well as have a 100% accurate move to hit Mega Pinsir with.. Aqua Tail gets great coverage and hits Ground-types such as Landorus and Hippowdon, while it also hits some other Pokemon such as Terrakion and Heatran for super effective damage. Aqua Tail and Taunt allow Mega Aerodactyl to beat Skarmory, which it cannot do otherwise. Roost is Mega Aerodactyl's form of recovery, mitigating hazard damage and allowing it to stay healthy throughout the match. This set could also run a coverage move to handle a specific threat to your team; however, it usually covers most of the metagame as it is. Rock Slide is a notable option over Aqua Tail because of its ability to OHKO Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, Staraptor, Mega Charizard Y, and Thundurus, which Aerodactyl cannot otherwise do.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>44 Defense EVs are very important because they enable Mega Aerodactyl to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Band Talonflame's Brave Bird all the time. 244 Attack EVs allow Mega Aerodactyl to OHKO Keldeo with Aerial Ace and Terrakion with Aqua Tail, while the Speed investment outspeeds Pokemon with 110 base Speed before Mega Evolving, and anything up to Greninja after Mega Evolving. This spread also gives defensive teams some offensive pressure, because Mega Aerodactyl can outspeed and revenge kill many Pokemon thanks to its high Speed. For more defensive teams, an EV spread of 248 HP / 204 Def / 56 Spe with a Jolly Nature can be run, providing more physical bulk to handle the likes of Talonflame and Mega Pinsir reliably while outspeeding up to Mega Pinsir. Aerodactylite is chosen over another item such as Leftovers to enable Aerodactyl to Mega Evolve and gain bulk, power, and Speed. In the long run, Aerodactylite provides many more benefits than Leftovers does, and Roost keeps it healthy as it is.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Should the opponent carry a Talonflame, it's best to preserve Mega Aerodactyl to wall it. This is also a great idea against Birdspam teams in general. Keep in mind that this set is meant to break stall and thus is most effective against stall teams. When facing Stall teams, Taunt is key. Taunt prevents hazards from being set, status from being spread, and recovery moves being used. Taunt is great against entry hazard leads as well, meaning that leading with Mega Aerodactyl isn't a bad idea either, as it can Mega Evolve early on in the game while keeping hazards off the field. Taunt also prevents Mega Aerodactyl from being inflicted with status. Roost should be used when Mega Aerodactyl's health is low, but it should not be used recklessly, as it has limited PP. Keep in mind that Roost removes Mega Aerodactyl's type temporarily, meaning it can be hit with Earthquake on the turn it used Roost.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Cleric support from Sylveon or Clefable is always helpful to remove status ailments and keep Mega Aerodactyl alive and healthy. These Pokemon also have good synergy with Mega Aerodactyl, which is an important factor to consider when choosing any teammate. Toxic support is great because Taunt means that any poisoned Pokemon cannot recover its health, effectively crippling it. Hazard removal is beneficial because Mega Aerodactyl is weak to Stealth Rock, thus making Rapid Spin support from Excadrill or Defog support from Latios a good idea. Quagsire has nice synergy with Mega Aerodactyl and can wall powerful threats such as Garchomp that Mega Aerodactyl struggles against. Partners such as Kyurem-B or Landorus that can break through Mega Venusaur are much appreciated.</p>\n"
