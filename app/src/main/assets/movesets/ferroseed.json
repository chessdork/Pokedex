     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Spikes are valuable for racking up residual damage every time opponents switch in, as well as breaking Focus Sashes. Stealth Rock should be used if other teammates lack it. STAB Gyro Ball allows Ferroseed to punish naturally faster Pokemon, Choice Scarf users, and Unburden users such as Slurpuff. However, Seed Bomb can be used instead of Gyro Ball as a STAB move, dealing huge amounts of damage against offensive threats such as Feraligatr, Floatzel, and Seismitoad. Leech Seed increases Ferroseed's longevity, and is a viable method of recovery. It often applies pressure to opponents to either switch out, or continue to take damage from Leech Seed. Protect can be useful for stalling in conjunction with Leech Seed, and is very useful for scouting opponent's arsenals to determine the appropriate plays. Thunder Wave can be used on switch-ins and can help to rack up Spikes damage by forcing switches. Leech Seed works well with Thunder Wave as it can apply pressure causing opponents to switch, allowing Ferroseed to capitalize with Thunder Wave and cripple dangerous threats such as Typhlosion, Magmortar, and Sawk.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Maximum HP and Defense investment helps Ferroseed tank a hit or two against physical powerhouses. Ferroseed takes advantage of Eviolite to bolster its Defense and Special Defense, making it a stronger wall. A Relaxed nature helps boost Ferroseed's Defense while also lowering its Speed, which benefits Ferroseed when using Gyro Ball. Alternatively, Ferroseed can invest in HP and Special Defense with a Sassy nature to make it a special wall capable of handling specially oriented Grass- and Water-types.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Start off by setting up entry hazards if possible, as this will apply pressure to the opponent, causing them to think more carefully about switching in and out. If there is no chance to set up hazards at first, start off with Protect to scout out the opponent\u2019s moves. Take full advantage of this to help determine what moves the opponent might have and what you can do to counter it. Set up a Leech Seed after hazards have been set up, and follow it up with Protect. This will help Ferroseed remain in control of the matchup; not only receiving HP each turn but also slowly wearing down opposing Pokemon. Opponents will attempt to switch; being able to determine switch-ins is key for Ferroseed as it can use Leech Seed on an incoming opponent to wear them down or Gyro Ball for damage. Use Gyro Ball after Protect to make sure Ferroseed recovers from any damage taken. Thunder Wave can also be used when opponents switch in to slow them down for setup sweepers. However, it's worth noting that Thunder Wave is somewhat counterproductive with Gyro Ball, so always think about when to utilize both. Being able to predict Poison-type moves is useful, as Ferroseed can be tossed into play, saving teammates such as Slurpuff, Lilligant, or even Granbull from danger.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Having teammates such as Dragalge works perfectly for Ferroseed, as Dragalge resists Fighting- and Fire-type moves and can take special attacks such as Focus Blast, Fire Blast, and Flamethrower relatively easily due to its high Special Defense. Teammates such as Feraligatr and Magmortar are great because of their offensive presence. Feraligatr can sweep teams if it can set up, often getting rid of Ferroseed's checks in the process. Magmortar can sweep severely weakened teams as well. Ghost-types such as Mismagius are wonderful for spinblocking and are immune to Fighting-types, bar Pangoro. Togetic, Vullaby, and Pelipper are all valuable teammates with Defog in case the field gets scattered with hazards, as Ferroseed dislikes them. Instead of utilizing Defog, Cryogonal and Sandslash may be used as spinners, so that you don't have to get rid of your own hazards. Bulky walls such as Camerupt and Rhydon are useful teammates to allow Ferroseed to switch in safely. Seismitoad is great against Fire-types due to its resistance to Fire, and Ferroseed can wall Grass-types for Seismitoad in return.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Thanks to its many resistances, Ferroseed makes an excellent hazard setter. Spikes is a great option, as Ferroseed forces many switches and can set them up with ease. Leech Seed lets Ferroseed regain health it may have lost from burn or hazards, annoys many Fire- and Fighting-type switch-ins, and can force a lot of switches as well. The third move is a toss-up. Protect is the preferred move, as it works well with Leech Seed, and is very useful for scouting out Choice-locked moves. However, Stealth Rock can be used if your team doesn't have a Pokemon that can set it. The last move is Thunder Wave because it allows Ferroseed to cripple many sweepers in the tier and lets Ferroseed support its teammates. There are no attacks on this set because Ferroseed's Attack stat is subpar, and it won't be doing a lot of damage to opposing Pokemon. In addition, it doesn't want to stay in Taunt users such as Sableye and Azelf, as the former can wear Ferroseed out with Will-O-Wisp and the latter can KO it with Fire Blast.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The given EV spread maximizes Ferroseed's physical bulk. A Impish nature is used to further increase Ferroseed's physical bulk. Eviolite is the only item that should be considered, as it boosts Ferroseed's defenses to formidable levels. Iron Barbs is the ability that should be used, and with Leech Seed and Protect, it racks up a lot of residual damage, and discourages Rapid Spin users such as Tentacruel from using Rapid Spin due to the extra chip damage.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Do not stay in on Knock Off users such as Sableye, because it will greatly hinder Ferroseed's longevity if its Eviolite is lost. In addition, do not stay in on super effective moves because they will most likely OHKO or 2HKO Ferroseed. Predicting the switch and using Leech Seed or setting up hazards is a good idea as Ferroseed forces a lot of switches. Try using Thunder Wave often; it's nice to support your teammates and cripple scary threats. Also, try not to get Taunted from the likes of Azelf or Crobat, as Ferroseed can't do anything back to them.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Wish passers such as Umbreon and Florges make great partners, healing Ferroseed and curing status with Heal Bell, as Ferroseed is often switched into Scald. In addition, bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, Jellicent, Milotic, and Alomomola have excellent type synergy with Ferroseed, as they can take on the super effective Fire-type moves aimed at Ferroseed, and in return, it can switch in on Electric- and Grass-type moves aimed at them. Jellicent, in particular, has excellent type synergy, being able to spinblock as well as being immune to Fighting-type moves.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>This is Ferroseed's most viable set. Spikes is the main move of the set, and provides chip damage every time a grounded Pokemon switches in. Stealth Rock can also fit the role of the preferred entry hazard, but Spikes is generally better as it is less common in the tier and there are other Stealth Rock setters such as Bronzong and Registeel. Leech Seed gradually wears down the opponent and is Ferroseed's only form of recovery. Protect can work well with Leech Seed in draining the opponent's health, but Thunder Wave can be used as an alternative to cripple faster threats such as Zangoose and Sceptile. Seed Bomb is to stop Ferroseed from being Taunt bait, and hits Kabutops and Rhyperior reasonably hard, while Gyro Ball can be used to hit Slurpuff.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>252 HP EVs maxes out Ferroseed's HP, letting it take hits much better. 252 Defense EVs with an Impish nature maximize Ferroseed's Defense, letting it take hits from Pokemon such as Rhyperior and Escavalier. However, a Relaxed nature should be used to maximize damage if it's using Gyro Ball. A specially defensive spread can also work to counter special Water-, Grass-, and Electric-type Pokemon better, but most of these Pokemon will pack coverage for Ferroseed, and the physically defensive spread is better for Escavalier and Sharpedo. An Eviolite is an absolute must, as it gives Ferroseed a notable boost to its defenses, which are its claim to fame in the tier. Lastly, Iron Barbs is the preferred ability for Ferroseed as it wears down the foe for every physical hit taken, and works well when used with Leech Seed.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>The most important thing to remember when using this set is to not stay in on Knock Off, as it gets rid of Eviolite, and to not stay in on Taunt, as it stops Ferroseed from using its support moves, which is one of the most important reasons to ever use Ferroseed. Ferroseed can also force some switches on Pokemon such as Sharpedo and Doublade lacking Sacred Sword, so predicting what will switch in correctly can provide a free turn of setting up Spikes or landing Thunder Wave on whatever switches in. Protect can also be used to scout out moves on unusual switch-ins, and can be used for a free turn of recovery if Leech Seed is up. Lastly, be careful when using Thunder Wave and Gyro Ball on the same set, as it can be counterproductive at times.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Aromatisse and Alomomola can be good partners as they can pass Wishes, and Ferroseed doesn't have any other means of recovery outside of Leech Seed. Alomomola can form a defensive core with Ferroseed, as Ferroseed can take super effective Grass-type and Electric-type moves for it, and in return, Alomomola can take super effective Fire-type moves for Ferroseed. Slowking also can form a defensive core and resists Fighting-type attacks as well, at the cost of not being able to take Knock Off well either. Jellicent can also form a defensive core with Ferroseed and has higher overall special bulk than Slowking and Alomomola, as well as the ability to spinblock. Doublade can also work as a spinblocker, but shares the same Fire-type weakness as Ferroseed which stops Doublade from forming a good defensive core with Ferroseed as effectively as Jellicent. Slower sweepers such as Gallade, Hitmonlee, and Moltres that can take advantage of Ferroseed's paralysis support make great partners. Moltres in particular is a good partner, as it not only takes advantage of the paralysis support, but also resists Ferroseed's weaknesses.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Leech Seed is one of the staple moves on Ferroseed, as it allows Ferroseed to gain small passive recovery, and also happens to be Ferroseed's most viable recovery option. Bullet Seed is the STAB move of choice, and it helps break Substitutes and beat Sturdy Tirtouga. Due to Ferroseed's incredible bulk, it has an easy time setting up entry hazards. Stealth Rock is the preferred hazard, only requiring one turn of setup, though Spikes can be used as well. Thunder Wave is the preferred move in the fourth moveslot, allowing Ferroseed to check Pokemon that might try and set up on it. It also allows Ferroseed to cripple any switch-ins. Protect can also be used in order to scout the opponent's moves, play mind games, and rack up Leech Seed damage.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Eviolite is always the preferred item for Ferroseed, giving it massive bulk. With the current EV spread, Ferroseed has defenses of 22 HP / 18 Def / 18 SpD, which is massive when paired with an Eviolite. Eviolite works extremely well because of Ferroseed's semi-reliable recovery in Leech Seed. Eviolite allows Ferroseed to take more hits overall, even to the point of sponging certain super effective attacks.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>The safest time to bring in Ferroseed is against Water-types and most Electric-types. Grass-types can also be safe to switch into in order to set up Stealth Rock or Spikes. Ferroseed should always try and use Leech Seed in order to stay healthy, and if it runs it, it should use Thunder Wave on obvious switch-ins. Opposing Pokemon can be whittled down if they lack a setup move, as the combination of Leech Seed and Bullet Seed will quickly bring any non-Grass-type to low health.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Spritzee is single-handedly the best partner for Ferroseed. Spritzee helps keep Ferroseed alive with Wish support and can switch in on common Fighting-types and immediately threaten them with Moonblast. If Ferroseed is running Thunder Wave, slow Pokemon make great partners. Honedge is excellent as Thunder Wave mitigates its low Speed, letting it run Shadow Claw instead of the weaker Shadow Sneak. Pokemon that can take Fire-type attacks make excellent partners for Ferroseed as well. Chinchou is great because it can repeatedly pivot in and out and appreciates Leech Seed recovery. Houndour and Ponyta are excellent as well, as they absorb Fire-type hits and immediately threaten with a strong attack of their own. Fighting-type resists are desirable as well. Trubbish makes a great partner, as it resists Fighting-type attacks, absorbs Knock Offs, and can even be a second entry hazard setter on a more stall-based team. Common revenge killers such as Fletchling make great partners, as Ferroseed tends to lure in setup sweepers like Scraggy. Pawniard is another great partner, as it can deter the opponent from using Defog, which can undo all of Ferroseed's hard work.</p>\n"
