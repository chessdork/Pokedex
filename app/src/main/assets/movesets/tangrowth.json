     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Leaf Storm is Tangrowth's main source of damage, OHKOing Pokemon that Tangrowth can easily switch into, such as Tail Glow Manaphy and Mega Gyarados after Stealth Rock, Terrakion, Rotom-W, and Keldeo. Giga Drain gives Tangrowth more staying power and a bit more longevity while not leaving it helpless after it KOes something, unlike with Leaf Storm, but the power loss is very noticeable and leaves Tangrowth unable to counter Manaphy, Keldeo, Mega Gyarados, and Terrakion. Knock Off is a great utility move to toss around and allows Tangrowth to deal with some of the Pokemon it checks, such as Latios, Gengar, and Latias. Earthquake deals with Excadrill, Heatran, Bisharp, and Mega Charizard X, all Pokemon that Tangrowth either checks or is checked by. In the last slot, there are three choices. Hidden Power Ice deals with the Ground-types that Tangrowth checks, such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, Landorus, and Gliscor, 2HKOing all of them. Hidden Power Fire covers Ferrothorn, Scizor, Skarmory, and Mega Pinsir, all Pokemon that could otherwise switch into Tangrowth with impunity. Both Hidden Power Ice and Hidden Power Fire also 2HKO Breloom. Lastly, Rock Slide covers Talonflame, Thundurus, and Mega Charizard Y, and it ensures that Substitute Kyurem-B can't set up on Tangrowth. However, with Rock Slide in the last slot, Tangrowth uses three physical attacks and is thus heavily crippled by burns, which is not ideal when it is expected to deal with Water-types throughout the game.</p>\n<p>Focus Blast can be used over Earthquake if you want Tangrowth to be crippled less by burns, but has poor accuracy and isn't as good as Earthquake at punishing Heatran switch-ins. In fact, even when Tangrowth is burned, Earthquake deals more damage to specially defensive Heatran than Focus Blast. Hidden Power Rock and Ancient Power are also possible options on the last slot if you expect Tangrowth to get burned often, though their lower power in comparison to Rock Slide means that they have no chance to OHKO Mega Charizard Y on the switch or 2HKO Thundurus without prior damage. Ancient Power's PP is usually enough and the rare stat boost comes in handy, but if PP is a concern, then go with Hidden Power Rock.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The EV spread is simple and aims to make Tangrowth as specially bulky as possible, while still giving it enough physical bulk to check threatening physical sweepers such as Mega Tyranitar and Mega Gyarados. A Speed-hindering nature is used because Tangrowth's Speed is already very low and Tangrowth doesn't want to lose any power.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This variant of Tangrowth is a great mixed tank, able to check a multitude of dangerous offensive Pokemon, such as Excadrill, Dragonite, Landorus, Thundurus, Breloom, Garchomp, Latios, Latias, Gengar, Gyarados, Keldeo, Tyranitar, Manaphy, and Azumarill. For this reason, it's a good pivot on offensive teams as a catch-all check to strong offensive Pokemon, as well as a few annoying pivots such as Rotom-W. Because Tangrowth has Regenerator, switching out a lot is recommended. Keep in mind that if the opponent has a Mega Evolution that can switch into Tangrowth with little trouble, such as Mega Charizard Y or Mega Pinsir, they are immune to Knock Off and can put a great deal of pressure on Tangrowth's team as they force Tangrowth out. Before these Pokemon have been KOed, you should constantly be double switching. </p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Rotom-W has great synergy with Tangrowth, covering its Fire, Ice, and Flying weaknesses and taking on Pokemon such as Mega Pinsir, Heatran, Talonflame, and Mamoswine. Mega Charizard X with Roost and Bulk Up Talonflame counter Mega Charizard Y, one of the biggest worries for Tangrowth, and they can also threaten the plethora of Grass- and Steel-types that wall Tangrowth, while Tangrowth can in return check the Water- and Ground-types that trouble them, such as Rotom-W, Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Choice Scarf Garchomp. Any Fire-type works well as a partner, but those two Fire-types have the added benefit of dealing with Mega Charizard Y. Entry hazard removal is nice, so that Tangrowth doesn't have to worry about defensive Steel-types such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn taking advantage of it and is free to use better coverage options. Mandibuzz deals with most Steel-types with Taunt, and can also check a lot of the physically offensive Pokemon that trouble Tangrowth, such as Mega Charizard X, Talonflame, and Mega Scizor, while Tangrowth checks Electric- and Water-types that give Mandibuzz a hard time, such as Rotom-W, Keldeo, and Thundurus. Slowbro has good synergy with Tangrowth and has Regenerator too, making for a potent pivoting duo that can switch in and out at will.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>This is the Tangrowth set you will see most often in the RU metagame. Sleep Powder is a fantastic move that can shut down would-be offensive counters to Tangrowth, such as Moltres and Braviary. Giga Drain is the primary choice for a STAB move to smash the likes of Rhyperior, Alomomola, and Kabutops on top of recovering health. If Fighting-types such as Hitmonlee and Gallade are of more concern, you can opt for Power Whip, as it hits them much harder. Focus Blast provides necessary coverage to hit most Steel-types in the tier, most notably Cobalion, which is a key physical threat Tangrowth has no issues with coming in on. Leech Seed is preferred in the last slot, as it allows Tangrowth to force switches and give itself and its teammates some passive healing. Synthesis is another healing option for Tangrowth that provides instant recovery. However, it's nerfed by Snow Warning and can be rather redundant if Tangrowth is using Giga Drain for its STAB move of choice. There are a couple of options to consider if neither healing option appeals to you. Stun Spore can paralyze some would-be sleep absorbers, but fails against many of the same Pokemon Sleep Powder does. Knock Off can remove items from the opposing Pokemon, potentially ruining their strategies for the rest of the match, but it can also keep the likes of Hitmonlee and Gallade from getting that stronger hit that they need to push through a defensive check.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The given EV spread maximizes Tangrowth's physical bulk while rounding down passive damage from Spikes or status damage. The STAB move you choose determines the nature Tangrowth should have. When using Giga Drain, a Bold nature should be used, while the use of Power Whip means Relaxed is the superior option. Leftovers is the best item option for Tangrowth, as it gives Tangrowth some extra recovery. If running Giga Drain, however, Rocky Helmet can be considered as a way to punish physical attackers that attempt to break through Tangrowth. Regenerator should always be Tangrowth's ability thanks to the passive healing it provides whenever Tangrowth switches out.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Tangrowth can easily be brought in against most physical attackers that can't hit it for super effective damage, such as Cobalion, Rhyperior, and Kabutops. While it may be tempting to bring it in on Sharpedo, it's best to first scout for Ice Beam before doing this as quite a few Sharpedo run the move to surprise Tangrowth. While Sleep Powder is a fantastic support move, there are quite a few Pokemon in RU that are immune to it. If you predict one of these immunities coming in, try to hit it with the appropriate attack, such as using Leech Seed on Escavalier to wear it down or Focus Blast on Virizion to get some chip damage. Do not stay in on an offensive special attacker unless you plan on sacrificing Tangrowth to set your win condition up.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Tangrowth may be a great physical wall, but it still has no chance against Escavalier. Moltres and Emboar are fine offensive responses to it, and both of them appreciate Tangrowth's ability to handle bulky Water-types for them. Alternatively, Qwilfish makes for a good defensive check thanks to Intimidate, and it can set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes. Just be wary of Toxic Spikes conflicting with Sleep Powder. Tangrowth has a serious issue with most Fire-types, especially Moltres and Delphox. Slowking forms a great Regenerator core with Tangrowth and happily takes on most Fire-types. Alomomola is another alternative, but it can struggle a bit more with Moltres and Calm Mind Delphox. Braviary can pose quite an issue for Tangrowth, so checks to that are appreciated. Despite the shared Fire-type weakness, Registeel can keep Braviary from mindlessly spamming Brave Bird. Rhyperior is another much more reliable answer to Braviary thanks to Solid Rock and higher physical bulk.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Giga Drain provides healing and a way to deal with Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types. Leaf Storm OHKOes max HP Rotom-W, Keldeo, Terrakion, and Mega Gyarados after Stealth Rock as regular Gyarados, and it fits well with Tangrowth's hit-and-run playstyle, though Giga Drain is preferred because this set really appreciates the extra staying power when facing threats such as Mega Tyranitar. Knock Off is a great move to throw around early-game. Sleep Powder cripples the physical sweepers Tangrowth checks, or an opposing check on the switch, givingTangrowth some much needed utility. Earthquake covers Excadrill, Heatran, Mega Charizard X, and Bisharp, all threatening Pokemon that would otherwise take advantage of Tangrowth or straight up beat it. Hidden Power Ice covers a lot of the Ground-types that Tangrowth can switch into, such as Landorus-T, Garchomp without Fire Blast, and Gliscor, as well as Dragonite. On the other hand, Hidden Power Fire covers Ferrothorn, Scizor, and Skarmory, but these Pokemon are easier to handle than the threats that Hidden Power Ice covers, making Hidden Power Ice the superior option. Leech Seed can be used somewhere on the set to annoy any non-Grass-type switch-in, but all of Tangrowth's other moves are usually too important to pass up.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>This set uses maximum physical bulk to allow Tangrowth to deal with Pokemon such as Swords Dance Garchomp, Terrakion, Azumarill, Mega Gyarados, Mega Tyranitar, Landorus-T, and Dragonite as well as possible.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Tangrowth is a sturdy physical wall that can reliably counter a lot of physical threats throughout the game. Be sure to use Tangrowth to its advantages over other Grass-types commonly seen in OU, though, including much better physical bulk, a Ground resistance, Knock Off, more power over Amoonguss, and better survivability than Mega Venusaur. Also, don't spam Knock Off when threatening Mega Evolutions are on the opponent's team, such as Mega Pinsir and Mega Charizard Y. Similarly, don't use Sleep Powder when Grass-types or Mandibuzz are on the opponent's team, or at least not unless it's absolutely necessary to do so, such as against a strong boosting sweeper that Tangrowth can't threaten otherwise. Finally, use Tangrowth as a pivot rather than a wall to take advantage of Regenerator and to avoid giving free switches to the dangerous Pokemon that Tangrowth attracts.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Rotom-W can check a lot of the Fire- and Flying-types that threaten Tangrowth, such as Talonflame, Heatran, Tornadus-T, and Mega Pinsir. Heatran takes care of the Grass- and Steel-types that wall Tangrowth, while Tangrowth takes care of Water- and Ground-types. Mega Charizard X and Y also work for this role, but they need more support because they are weak to Stealth Rock. Assault Vest Slowking checks many special attackers that Tangrowth has problems against, and the two form a Regenerator core that is both physically and specially bulky.</p>\n"

As Grass-type moves are resisted by many other types, Tangrowth's other moves are designed to take care of them. Focus Blast is a necessity to hammer Steel-types, such as Registeel, Cobalion, and Bronzong. Ancient Power is generally the best option in the next slot for its ability to smack opposing Fire- and Flying-types, such as Braviary and Moltres. Hidden Power Fire is a nice alternative if your team struggles with Escavalier and Doublade. Sleep Powder gets the nod in the last slot, as putting an offensive check or counter to sleep can be a game changer. Giga Drain is an alternative, as it provides Tangrowth with a reliable STAB move with no drawbacks, which can be helpful for when the opponent has dangerous setup sweepers left on their team.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The EV spread focuses on Tangrowth's solid Special Attack, while also letting it outspeed Alomomola before it can use a support move such as Toxic or Wish. Do note that you will need to move 4 HP EVs over to Speed if you use Hidden Power Fire as that requires an imperfect Speed IV. Choice Specs is the primary option, as Tangrowth benefits from switching out a lot thanks to Regenerator. Life Orb is certainly an option, as it allows Tangrowth the freedom to switch moves and use Sleep Powder more reliably.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This Tangrowth thrives on switching into weak or resisted physical attacks and unleashing powerful attacks itself. As strong as Leaf Storm is, be cautious when using it. Moltres, Braviary, and Delphox are very dangerous setup sweepers that will jump at the chance to set up on a -2 Tangrowth. If you decide to use Sleep Powder on Tangrowth, saving it until after your opponent realizes you are equipped with Choice Specs or Life Orb is generally the best way to use it, as they'll be less wary of it after that. Try to stay away from Knock Off. While Tangrowth generally has no problems being able to tank the move, it sorely misses the power boost provided by Choice Specs or Life Orb.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Tangrowth is a fantastic offensive pivot and greatly appreciates entry hazard support to wear down typical responses to it. Stealth Rock is key, as many Pokemon that resist Grass-type attacks are weak to Stealth Rock. Cobalion, Rhyperior, and Druddigon are all reliable Stealth Rock users to use with Tangrowth. Spikes can help wear down the likes of Amoonguss, Registeel, and Aromatisse very quickly. Accelgor, Qwilfish, and Omastar can all utilize Spikes effectively. If you opt not to run Hidden Power Fire, you will need an Escavalier check. Moltres is the most reliable offensive check to it, but Emboar can work as well, so long as you avoid Drill Run. If Tangrowth lacks AncientPower, you will need checks to Moltres. Assault Vest Slowking is a fantastic counter to Moltres and forms a very sturdy Regenerator core with Tangrowth that is difficult to set up on. Registeel can reliably set up Stealth Rock which can help Tangrowth immensely. As this Tangrowth can punch holes in opposing defensive cores, having cleaners or Choice Scarf users to clean up late-game is a good idea. Jolteon, Rotom-C, Emboar, and Sharpedo can all fill this role effectively.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>One of Tangrowth's biggest problems is its lackluster Special Defense. However, this set attempts to fix this issue by giving a boost to Tangrowth's Special Defense in the form of an Assault Vest, so it can take better advantage of its Water-, Electric-, and Grass-type resistances. Giga Drain is the primary STAB move, as it provides reliable healing and deals with the likes of Rhyperior, Alomomola, and Kabutops. Leaf Storm is an alternative for a much stronger option. While the stat drops are annoying, they aren't detrimental, as Tangrowth has Regenerator to benefit from switching out. Knock Off is able to remove items and possibly ruin strategies, making it a very good move to use early on. Hidden Power Fire catches Steel- and Grass-types for reliable damage. It can also defeat Escavalier should Tangrowth catch it with Knock Off on the switch. Earthquake is the primary option in the final slot to nail incoming Fire- and Poison-types hoping to switch into a Grass-type move with relative impunity. However, Rock Slide is an option for Flying-types, mainly Moltres. Poison Jab is usable to nail Aromatisse and fellow Grass-types, but Tangrowth has a hard time finding room for it on this set.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The EV spread maximizes Tangrowth's Special Attack and HP while rounding down passive damage. Assault Vest is used to bolster Tangrowth's Special Defense to respectable levels while a Quiet nature is recommended so Tangrowth's physical attacks don't get powered down.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Tangrowth still prefers to come in on weak or resisted physical attacks, so as to not blow the cover of Assault Vest immediately. While the bolstered special bulk is nice, don't try testing your luck against the likes of Moltres or Delphox, as Tangrowth still doesn't stand a chance against them. Avoid Knock Off like it's the plague. Tangrowth can take it without suffering too much damage, but losing the special bulk provided by Assault Vest is highly detrimental to this set.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>This Tangrowth is more of a mixed tank, so it appreciates teammates that can take on its weaknesses from both sides of the spectrum. Alomomola is capable of handling most physical attackers that Tangrowth can't while also spreading burns with Scald. Slowking is generally the same, but from the special side instead of the physical side. Both form sturdy Regenerator cores with Tangrowth that can be difficult to break apart. Registeel is able to set up Stealth Rock which can help Tangrowth as it can force many switches. Qwilfish can check Escavalier and Durant while setting up Spikes and Toxic Spikes to support Tangrowth. Aromatisse is able to reliably check most Fighting-types, while absorbing Knock Off with relative ease. It can also provide Cleric support in the event that Tangrowth gets burned or poisoned. Offensive teammates, such as Moltres, Jolteon, Cobalion, and Kabutops, appreciate Tangrowth's ability to switch in on their weaknesses without giving up a lot of momentum, while most can also find opportunities to switch in on various attacks aimed at Tangrowth.</p>\n"
