     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Bulk Up is the main move, often slowly building a sweep against bulky offense teams. Knock Off is excellent utility, and helps cut down on opposing recovery. Knock Off also messes with more stall-based teams. Drain Punch gives Scrafty psuedo-recovery, and can really hit hard with a boost. This is Scrafty's most reliable way to heal. Rest is a keystone to the Bulk Up set, as Rest allows Scrafty to fully heal up and proceed to rack up Bulk Up boosts again. However, Shed Skin does not always activate, often sealing Scrafty's fate. Iron Head can be used to deal with Florges, although it fails to OHKO Florges even at +1, and so should only be used either on the switch or late-game. Zen Headbutt can be used to catch Toxicroak off-guard, although Rest is usually preferred in the last slot.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>252 HP and Special Defense EVs assure maximum special bulk, and easily let Scrafty set up on Pokemon like Crocune. Shed Skin allows Scrafty to potentially get a one-turn sleep, and can stop other status effects. Shed Skin also allows Scrafty to not be shut down by Sableye, setting Scrafty apart from other Fighting-types.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Scrafty should be used against Pokemon that commonly run a RestTalk set, as Scrafty will then be able to set up easily. If Scrafty can take a hit from something or force it out, then Scrafty is usually fine to set up. Do not set up if a Pokemon such as Florges or Mienshao is on the opposing team. It is best to get entry hazards up before setting up, in order to limit the amount of switches on the opposing team.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Pokemon such as Qwilfish or Hitmontop can help support Scrafty. Both can do work against Fighting-types, and Qwilfish can set up Spikes and Toxic Spikes. Hitmontop can help weaken Pokemon such as Florges by hitting them with Toxic. Pokemon that lure in Crocune or Vaporeon can help set up a Scrafty sweep. A switch-in to Crobat is nice, making Raikou or Rhyperior great partners. Raikou can set up on a lot of Pokemon that Scrafty lures in, while Rhyperior can set up Stealth Rock. Bronzong is a good partner, as Bronzong easily beats Florges while also setting up Stealth Rock. In a similar vein, most Pokemon that can beat Florges can make a great partner to Scrafty. Paralysis support is extremely beneficial, even more so than to the Dragon Dance set, as Scrafty has extremely low Speed. Slowbro, Mew, and Celebi are usually all bulky and can spread status. They all can also take Fighting-type attacks aimed at Scrafty. Florges can be a decent partner, as Florges can beat most Mienshao sets and lures in Nidoking and Nidoqueen for Scrafty to set up on.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>This set allows Scrafty to make the most of its great offensive typing and good movepool to provide helpful Fake Out support to the team. Fake Out allows Scrafty to immobilize one of the opponents for a turn, which lets Scrafty's partner make a move without having to worry. Knock Off is a powerful STAB attack which hits Ghost- and Psychic-types for super effective damage, also removing the foe's item. Drain Punch is Scrafty's secondary STAB attack, hitting Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Bisharp for super effective damage; it also recovers Scrafty's health and gets great neutral coverage with Knock Off. Stone Edge is used to hit Flying-types such as Thundurus and Mega Charizard Y for super effective damage. Rock Slide is not recommended because it is far too weak and doesn't even OHKO Mega Charizard Y. Ice Punch is an option over Stone Edge to hit Landorus, Salamence, Shaymin-S, and Garchomp harder. Detect can be used if using a Sitrus Berry, as it allows Scrafty to scout for Fake Out and a potential super effective attack while also stalling Trick Room turns and weather conditions. It is used over Protect on the off chance that the opponent has Imprison and Protect, but still provides the same utility.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The suggested EV spread allows Scrafty to take a Life Orb-boosted Secret Sword from Keldeo or two Heat Waves from Mega Charizard Y if it is holding an Assault Vest. A spread of 248 HP / 196 Atk / 64 SpD should be used if using a Sitrus Berry as it allows Scrafty to survive a Modest Mega Charizard Y's Overheat. A Brave nature with 0 Speed IVs can be used if Scrafty is being used on a Trick Room team, as Scrafty's low Speed stat can be used to good effect on those teams. Assault Vest is the recommended item to increase Scrafty's Special Defense while the EV spread increases Scrafty's Defense stat. Sitrus Berry is also a very viable option as it allows Scrafty to survive some 2HKOs, such as Mega Kangaskhan's Double-Edge. An alternate spread of 252 HP / 180 Atk / 56 Def / 20 SpD could be used with a Sitrus Berry, as it allows Scrafty to avoid a 2HKO from Mega Charizard Y's Heat Wave and Mega Kangaskhan's Double-Edge as well as avoid an OHKO from a +1 Mega Kangaskhan's Return. Lum Berry is also an option to protect Scrafty from status moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave, while Chople Berry is another good item that allows Scrafty to survive powerful attacks such as Hitmontop's Close Combat.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Scrafty is best used early-game because of its ability to give free turns to Pokemon like Scizor, Heatran, and Garchomp with Fake Out and Intimidate. However, it can still work well later in the match as a pivot because of the utility that Fake Out and Intimidate can provide, and Assault Vest or Sitrus Berry both give Scrafty more staying power. When up against Will-O-Wisp users such as Rotom-W, it is best to switch out as Scrafty cannot OHKO them and becomes somewhat useless when burned, hitting for very little damage, although it can still support a team thanks to Knock Off, Fake Out, and Intimidate. Avoid switching into Pokemon with the Defiant ability such as Bisharp and Tornadus, as they gain a +1 Attack boost from Intimidate and can proceed to do a lot of damage to your team. Scrafty works well against Trick Room teams because it can beat common Trick Room setters with Fake Out and Knock Off, as most setters are either Ghost- or Psychic-types. It also works well on Trick Room teams due to Fake Out and Intimidate helping partners set up Trick Room with relative ease.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Aegislash is a good partner for Scrafty, as it resists Fairy- and Flying-type attacks and is immune to Fighting-type attacks while also being able to beat the users of these moves. Scrafty resists Dark- and Ghost-type attacks for Aegislash, so both Pokemon benefit. Bisharp is able to defeat Fairy-types with a STAB Iron Head and can deter Intimidate users from switching in with Defiant. However, it does share a Fighting-type weakness with Scrafty, so Pokemon like Keldeo can beat them both. Scizor is also a nice partner as it can defeat Fairy-types that give Scrafty trouble with Bullet Punch and appreciates Scrafty's ability to lure and remove Landorus-T and Mega Charizard Y with Ice Punch and Stone Edge, respectively. Scrafty can also create an opportunity for Scizor to set up a Swords Dance with Fake Out. Landorus-T is a decent partner, as it appreciates the free turns provides by Fake Out as well as Scrafty's ability to defeat Ice-types with Drain Punch. Landorus-T also covers Scrafty's Fighting-type weakness and can form a double Intimidate core with it. Scrafty can also beat Cresselia for Landorus-T. However, a double Intimidate core can be a disadvantage when facing Defiant Pokemon such as Bisharp, as they can gain a free +2 Attack boost. Scrafty works fairly well on Trick Room teams due to its great typing, Intimidate, and Fake Out, making Pokemon such as Cresselia and Aromatisse good partners to set up Trick Room while Scrafty supports their setup with Fake Out. They also resist the Fighting-type attacks that Scrafty is weak to. Mega Mawile is a good partner in Trick Room, as it resists Fairy- and Flying-type attacks. Rotom-W is also a strong partner as it can handle Flying-types such as Talonflame while also checking Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Hitmontop by using Will-O-Wisp.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Knock Off is the Dark-type STAB move of choice, and it can help with wearing down Scrafty and its teammates' own checks and counters by removing Leftovers and Assault Vests. Drain Punch is the preferred STAB attack, and helps to preserve Scrafty's longevity. Drain Punch is best used when using Scrafty as a mid- and late-game sweeper. High Jump Kick can be used in order to provide more immediate power, as well as to severely dent any switch-ins. It should be used when Scrafty is functioning as a wallbreaker on a team. Zen Headbutt is Scrafty's best option against Toxicroak, and it also prevents Pokemon such as Nidoqueen, Roserade, and Amoonguss from scaring Scrafty out. It also gets super effective damage on Mienshao, Hitmontop, and Chesnaught, although it cannot KO any of them except Mienshao. Iron Head allows Scrafty to do excellent damage on weakened Florges and Gardevoir, although it does not always OHKO even specially defensive Florges at +1.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Max Attack and Speed make Scrafty a strong sweeper. 252 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature allow Scrafty to outspeed Mienshao after a boost. Leftovers is preferred when using Drain Punch and Shed Skin in order to allow Scrafty to stay alive over the duration of the match. Life Orb is preferred when using High Jump Kick and/or Moxie, as this allows Scrafty to sweep extremely well late-game. Lum Berry is an option when using Moxie, although if you are that worried about status, you could just use Shed Skin. Shed Skin is the preferred ability, as this allows Scrafty to act as a psuedo-status absorber and not have to worry about a burn or a paralysis ruining Scrafy's sweep. However, Moxie can be used to steamroll through unprepared teams, racking up boost after boost.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Scrafty should set up on Pokemon that don't deal a lot of damage to it; these are usually special attackers. It can function greatly against stall-based teams. With Shed Skin, it usually does not mind burns, so setting up on Pokemon such as Crocune or Vaporeon can quickly turn a match around. Shed Skin also allows Scrafty to be the only Fighting-type to not be shut down by Sableye, granting it a niche of its own. Late-game, Scrafty should abuse its unique typing and try to force switches to set up a Dragon Dance.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Pokemon that can set entry hazards up can really help with wearing down Scrafty's checks and counters. With Moxie this puts immense pressure on a team. Gligar is an excellent teammate, as it can beat Crobat, Choice Scarf Honchkrow, and Mienshao, which all beat Scrafty. Gligar can also set up Stealth Rock to wear down the opponent's team. Pokemon such as Choice Band Machamp that can bait in Florges make excellent partners, as Florges is quickly overwhelmed by such strong attacks. Scrafty appreciates Thunder Wave support, making Pokemon such as Slowbro, Mew, Celebi, and Jirachi decent partners. Amoonguss can perform a similar role in spreading sleep and paralysis, although this compounds a Honchkrow weakness. Ghost-type Pokemon such as Froslass or Cofagrigus can switch in on Fighting-type attacks. Froslass can easily set up a layer or two of Spikes and eliminate a key threat with Destiny Bond, while Cofagrigus can switch in easily on Pokemon such as Crobat or Mienshao.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>This move lineup takes the best Scrafty has to offer and puts it all together for a nice Fake Out set. Fake Out is very useful at temporarily postponing the opponent's attempts to set up during the first turn, as well as stalling out passive damage from status and weather. Drain Punch is the primary STAB of choice, helping Scrafty prolong its lifespan while still dealing respectable damage. If a Fighting-type move is not the most optimal choice to use, Crunch is the secondary STAB that can hit Ghost- and Psychic-types.</p>\n<p>The last moveslot is down to what you prefer and/or what your team needs. Detect is the protection of choice, as it shields Scrafty from damage while is also able to escape many attempts at Imprisonment. If protection is not a concern, Ice Punch is the elemental punch of choice, covering Scrafty's Flying-type weakness and giving it nice overall coverage. Stone Edge can be used for handling Talonflame and Mega Charizard if they are a major concern. Lastly, Quick Guard is useful for blocking Talonflame's priority Brave Bird, although it doesn't have much use besides that.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The EV investment is fairly straightforward. Scrafty is fairly slow, and investing in Speed won't allow it to reach any significantly higher speed tiers; therefore, there is no need to invest in Speed. Most of the EVs therefore go into Scrafty's HP and Attack. However, there are also 12 EVs invested into Defense. This is to ensure that Scrafty can survive a Brave Bird from max Attack Choice Band Talonflame after an Intimidate. A Brave nature can also be used if you intend to run a Trick Room-oriented team.</p>\n<p>The choice of item largely depends on what is necessary for your team. A Lum Berry can help against the burns that limit Scrafty's power, and it is also a great answer to Smeargle. However, if status is not a problem, Assault Vest is a viable alternative for expanding Scrafty's special bulk. Keep in mind that running Assault Vest sacrifices the ability to use Detect.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Scrafty, as the set name implies, excels at hindering the opponents with Intimidate and Fake Out. Therefore, using the aforementioned two correctly is strongly advised. It is important to know when to use Scrafty as an Intimidate lead and when to use it as a backup plan for physical sweepers. If you are anticipating one of the opponent's Pok\u00e9mon to pack its own Fake Out, don't send out Scrafty first. The opponent will target Scrafty, and you will lose the Fake Out war due to Scrafty's low Speed. Likewise, it is important to know exactly which Pok\u00e9mon should be held back with Fake Out. One wrong prediction, and Scrafty is essentially running only three moves until it switches out. Speaking of switching out, Scrafty can be switched in and out of battle multiple times if need be. This is especially useful if you want to use Intimidate and/or Fake Out multiple times.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Scrafty is a naturally slow Pok\u00e9mon, sitting at a below-average base 50 Speed, and thus Trick Room is a viable strategy to run. Pok\u00e9mon that use it well include Aromatisse, Reuniclus, and Slowbro. Scrafty does not have the desired sky-high offenses, so Pok\u00e9mon that can remedy this with high offenses of their own and benefit from Fake Out and Intimidate also make for excellent partners, with Mega Charizard Y, Mega Kangaskhan, and Choice Gardevoir being notable examples. Finally, Aegislash deserves a special mention, as it resists all of Scrafty's weaknesses and hits hard in return, while Scrafty covers its Dark and Ghost weaknesses.</p>\n"
