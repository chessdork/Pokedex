     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>As usual, Thunderbolt is the main move on this set, as it provides a STAB move, power, and coverage in one slot. Knock Off is a reasonably useful option that not only hits Gengar, Latias, Latios, and other Psychic- and Ghost-types very hard, but also deprives other targets of their precious items, meaning bulky Pokemon such as Zapdos and Chansey lose their Leftovers and Eviolite, respectively. It is also a fail-safe option in case there is a Pokemon that can easily switch into Thundurus's other moves. Superpower provides Thundurus a somewhat reliable means of beating Blissey, Chansey, Tyranitar, and Heatran, all of which are important parts of defensive cores. Thunder Wave is another useful move that can paralyze fast opponents. Hidden Power Ice is very important for hitting Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor, all of which tank this set's other attacks with ease. </p>\n<p>U-turn, on the other hand, allows Thundurus to escape these same counters, as well as others, and switch to another teammate to keep up momentum. Taunt prevents walls such as Quagsire, Hippowdon, and Chansey from healing themselves and stalling Thundurus out with Life Orb recoil. With Prankster, Taunt also instantly stops hazard setters and boosting threats in their tracks. Grass Knot is an option to lure in Hippowdon and Quagsire if you would prefer to get rid of them instantly, while Psychic hits Conkeldurr and Mega Venusaur, two important checks to this set.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>76 EVs in Attack are used to juice up Knock Off, enabling Thundurus to OHKO Latios after Stealth Rock damage. Speed is maximized so that Thundurus can outrun base 110 Speed Pokemon as well as tie with opposing Thundurus and Tornadus, and the remaining EVs are put into Special Attack for more special offense. A Life Orb is required on this set, as it maximizes this set's offensive potential, and the physical moves are quite weak without it.</p>\n<p>Prankster is the preferred ability if Thundurus happens to use any status moves, as it increases its utility, and the Defiant boost is not worth obtaining if Knock Off is the only physical move used. If this is not the case, however, Defiant is the better ability to use, as the occasional Attack boosts for Superpower and Knock Off might actually come in handy against teams with Defog and Intimidate.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Mixed Thundurus is particularly skilled at breaking down common defensive cores while still operating as a solid threat against balanced and offensive teams. Specifically, this set performs especially well against teams reliant on Chansey, Blissey, Skarmory, Tyranitar, Keldeo, and Celebi. As such, it is best to use Thundurus early- to mid-game, when his checks and counters will likely be present and thus more vulnerable to being lured and killed or crippled by this set. As a note, don't be afraid to attack head-on, as Thundurus has the power, Speed, and freedom to overpower most switch-ins. Also keep in mind this set suffers from coverage issues against Ground-types without Grass Knot, so it is recommended to play around threats such as Quagsire and Hippowdon before going full-force.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>This set thrives greatly with entry hazard support on offensive teams, as it forces a great number of switches and appreciates the extra damage to achieve KOs on designated targets; Blissey, for example, isn't OHKOed without at least one layer of Spikes on the field. Several Pokemon, especially Landorus, Talonflame, and Latios, appreciate Thundurus's ability to weaken defensive cores involving Blissey, Celebi, Chansey, Skarmory, Tyranitar, and others. Finally, backup insurance against these threats is required if Thundurus gets KOed too early to take care of them; again, Landorus is a good choice for this, in addition to other offensive Pokemon such as Keldeo.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Nasty Plot makes the impending thunderstorms extra nasty; after a boost, Thundurus's attacks deal disastrous damage to nearly all non-resistant threats, and can even break through a few special walls, allowing Thundurus to act as both a sweeper and a wallbreaker. Thunderbolt is the main attack due to its reliability and accuracy; it also achieves good neutral coverage against the majority of the tier. Hidden Power Flying offers the best two-move neutral coverage alongside Thunderbolt, benefitting from STAB and the ability to hit Amoonguss and Venusaur super effectively. Hidden Power Ice is another great coverage option that hits certain Grass-, Ground-, Flying-, and Dragon-type threats, and it especially helps to KO Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor without relying on a boost. Hidden Power Ice should be used over Hidden Power Flying if super effective coverage and KOs on these threats is a concern.</p>\n<p>Thunder Wave gives Thundurus valuable utility against faster threats in desperate situations and makes him useful outside of attempting to sweep. Of course, this leaves Thundurus more vulnerable to threats such as Excadrill, Tyranitar, Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Chansey, so team support is required for these Pokemon. Substitute is a good alternative, as it prevents status and revenge kills. However, like Thunder Wave, it limits Thundurus's coverage, making him reliant on alternative offensive support. If coverage is a concern, Focus Blast hurts a few significant defensive threats, especially Tyranitar, Ferrothorn, and Blissey. Psychic can alternatively be used to hit Mega Venusaur and Conkeldurr if you want Thundurus to keep Hidden Power Ice to retain coverage against Gliscor and Garchomp.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>This set should ideally be as fast and powerful as possible without relying on boosts, so maximizing Special Attack and Speed with a Timid nature is required. For items, Leftovers gives Thundurus great flexibility and doesn't wear him down as often as Life Orb. However, Life Orb gives Thundurus initial power and allows him to hit hard regardless of a boost. Lum Berry is specifically useful against threats that are reliant on status, giving Thundurus an opportunity to Nasty Plot in the face of a status move from a wall or support Pokemon like Chansey, Gastrodon, Breloom, or Mega Venusaur, and then KO with a +2 attack. However, these situations are decidedly rare, and Thundurus typically appreciates durability or extra power more. Expert Belt is also a decent item, allowing Thundurus to grab some extra KOs, such as an OHKO on Latios with +2 Hidden Power Ice and Chansey with +6 Focus Blast, while making him less vulnerable to being worn down and stalled out, as would happen with Life Orb.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Thundurus forces out plenty of threats and has decent defensive typing, giving him plenty of opportunities to set up in front of threats that can't do much damage to him, such as Scizor, Ferrothorn, Rotom-W, Mandibuzz, and -2 Latios and Latias. Remember that Thundurus is perfectly strong without a Nasty Plot boost, so determine whether or not he actually needs one in specific situations. Consider if a threat needs to be eliminated immediately or if a boost wouldn't achieve any extra KOs. This set also works best as a late-game sweeper after checks and counters have been weakened or eliminated, although it can also operate as an early- to mid-game wallbreaker if you have alternative offensive Pokemon to clean up.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>This set appreciates teammates that can compensate for possible coverage issues, which tend to crop up if it uses a specific Hidden Power, Substitute, or Thunder Wave. Depending on the attack(s) used or lack thereof, Thundurus will require offensive support against threats such as Latias, Goodra, Chansey, specially defensive Hippowdon, Mega Venusaur, Tyranitar, and Heatran. Bisharp easily handles a majority of these Pokemon and can tailor its set to either trap Latias with Pursuit or set up its own sweep with Swords Dance. Life Orb Latios is also good against these Pokemon due to its power, Speed, and good coverage, with the additional benefit of being able to use Defog. Offensive lures are also solid teammates; Knock Off Landorus and Taunt Mega Gardevoir, for example, cripple defensive walls, preventing them from healing and functioning properly, and do huge damage to the aforementioned counters. Shadow Tag Gothitelle is a more direct and effective response to most of these threats, as it can either KO or cripple them. Finally, dual screens support isn't too necessary, but nevertheless helps Thundurus attain opportunities to set up and protects him from potential revenge kills. Klefki is notable for being able to set up Reflect and Light Screen reliably while also being able to lay down an entry hazard or two.</p>\n<p>Speaking of entry hazards, besides Stealth Rock and Spikes, one particular hazard that helps this set sweep successfully is Sticky Web. Most of Thundurus's faster checks are grounded, while Thundurus is fast enough to outrun and KO a majority of non-Scarved airborne threats that aren't affected by Sticky Web. Depending on your team, Smeargle and Shuckle are both viable choices of Sticky Web user.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Prankster Thunder Wave instantly paralyzes nearly any non-Electric- or Ground-type threat, allowing Thundurus to check most boosted or naturally fast threats he comes across. Thunderbolt is the main attacking move thanks to STAB typing and its good coverage against common Flying- and Water-type threats. Hidden Power Ice provides important coverage in conjunction with Thunderbolt against certain Ground- and Dragon-type threats, especially Garchomp, Landorus, Gliscor, and Dragonite. It also hits the rare, but occasional Grass-type when needed.</p>\n<p>In the last slot, Focus Blast further improves Thundurus's coverage, giving him a better fighting chance against threats such as Tyranitar, Heatran, Ferrothorn, Kyurem-B, and opposing Electric-types. Psychic can be used as an alternative coverage option to hit Poison- and Fighting-types hard, especially Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Conkeldurr. Taunt provides great utility against teams and threats that are reliant on status moves, mostly for stallbreaking. Taunt lets Thundurus beat Hippowdon without a Rock-type move and prevents opposing hazard, status, and recovery moves, making things difficult for defensive teams. If these moves are unnecessary to you, then they can be replaced with Volt Switch to scout, escape from, and ease prediction against checks and counters. U-turn is a less effective alternative, but it comes with the benefit of hitting Ground-types that Volt Switch can't hit. Substitute can also be used to protect Thundurus from revenge kills and status, and blocks stat-dropping moves such as Draco Meteor, allowing Thundurus to win against Latios. Coupled with Thunder Wave, it also lets Thundurus fish for full paralysis in desperate situations. Substitute also lets it Life Orb stall weakened threats like Greninja.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>This Thundurus is a simple special attacker and thus requires maximized Special Attack and Speed. A Timid nature is recommended to make Thundurus as fast as possible, and while a Naive nature is an option for a slight boost in U-turn damage, the boost is arguably negligible, so it is fine to use it with Timid. As this set does not employ physical attacks and relies on Prankster to give priority to Thunder Wave, don't even consider Defiant.</p>\n<p>Life Orb gives Thundurus a sharper edge, allowing him to force switches more often and potentially rack up even more entry hazard damage. It lets it 2HKO Latios after Stealth Rock damage, OHKO Garchomp, OHKO Landorus-T, 2HKO Quagsire, 2HKO most Zapdos, and much more. Leftovers is an equally useful option that grants Thundurus more longevity, allowing him to come in, attack, and cripple things more often. Finally, Expert Belt is a decent compromise between the aforementioned items, providing Thundurus significant power for super effective attacks while not affecting longevity. Expert Belt's boost is less than Life Orb's, but it nevertheless lets Thundurus achieve some very important KOs that he can't with Leftovers; for instance, Hidden Power Ice can now OHKO 4 HP / 0 SpD Garchomp and 252 HP / 4 SpD Landorus-T and 2HKO Latios. Expert Belt-boosted Focus Blast also OHKOes Ferrothorn after it takes one Thunderbolt, even after one turn of Leftovers.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This set is best used as a supporting attacker, as Thundurus can hit hard while using his priority Thunder Wave as a check against dangerous fast threats, especially boosted sweepers and Choice Scarf users. Use Thunder Wave scarcely and only when necessary, as Thundurus is already naturally fast, and paralysis is redundant in many situations against slower targets where it is preferable to attack outright. If the opposing team has a threat that your team badly needs paralyzed, try to be conservative when switching Thundurus in until he successfully does the job. Outside of paralyzing threats, simply keep attacking to maintain offensive pressure, but also be aware of which targets Thundurus can't afford to stay in against.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>This set doesn't need many teammates because it's a supporting attacker, although on many occasions, it requires teammates that can make up for its coverage issues, which tend to crop up horribly if it uses U-turn over other moves. If lacking Psychic, Gothitelle is a great teammate to use, as it can trap counters such as Mega Venusaur, Chansey, Quagsire, and Conkeldurr and use the appropriate move to deal with them. Gothitelle is notably slow, so Thundurus's ability to paralyze his targets makes the partnership solid. Aside from this, many offensive Pokemon in general appreciate Thundurus's ability to paralyze things; to be safe, however, it is recommended to employ Pokemon that are naturally fast so your team doesn't become too reliant on paralysis. Mega Gardevoir, Mega Charizard Y, and Sheer Force Landorus are just a few examples of powerful Pokemon that appreciate paralysis but are also fast enough to stand on their own in desperate situations. Although not too necessary, this set also appreciates entry hazard support to amplify offensive pressure. Even a single layer of Spikes or Stealth Rock helps in the long run, and this can easily be provided by Chansey, Hippowdon, and many others, depending on your team.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Thunder Wave is the main reason to use Thundurus. Thanks to the priority boost it receives from Prankster, the move allows Thundurus to shut down countless offensive threats, including Xerneas and Mewtwo, even if they are statistically faster. Taunt also benefits from Prankster and stops moves such as Defog and Stealth Rock. It's notably useful against Deoxys-S lacking Magic Coat as well. Volt Switch is deceptively powerful with a Life Orb boost and can create momentum for Thundurus's team, though Thunderbolt can be used instead if its greater power and lack of a forced switch effect are preferred. Grass Knot is the optimal choice in the final slot, hitting Ground-types such as Groudon and Hippowdon for large amounts of damage. However, Hidden Power Ice can be used instead to OHKO Landorus-T and deal a solid amount of damage to Zekrom. Superpower is also an option to hit foes such as Dialga, Excadrill, and Tyranitar harder than any of the previously mentioned moves can.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Maximum EV investment in Special Attack and Speed lets Thundurus hit as hard and fast as possible, as it is extremely fragile. A Timid nature is necessary in order for Thundurus to outspeed Palkia and slower Arceus formes. Prankster is the obvious ability choice, while a Life Orb is used to make Thundurus's attacks moderately stronger. If Superpower is used, Thundurus's nature should be changed to Naive and the Defense EVs should be moved into Attack.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>The main draw of using Thundurus is its Prankster Thunder Wave, which can stop a Speed-boosting sweeper or otherwise fast threat in its tracks. Aside from this, Thundurus can easily switch in against and threaten many Ground-types; it won't get many other opportunities to switch in, so make use of this fact. Additionally, Thundurus is a great choice to lead with, particularly because of its ability to stop entry hazard users with Taunt. Finally, Volt Switch is a great tool to have that can often bail Thundurus out of an unfavorable matchup.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Thundurus is best suited on offensive teams, where ideal teammates for it begin with U-turn users such as Genesect that can help form a VoltTurn core. Ground-types also work well with Thundurus&mdash;Excadrill is a fantastic teammate as it can check Zekrom, Electric Arceus, and Dialga, while Thundurus handles Ground- and Fighting-type moves and can use Volt Switch to bring it in safely. Dialga itself is also a great partner, checking Electric- and Grass-types while Thundurus covers its two weaknesses. Fairy-types such as Xerneas are good teammates for dealing with Dragon-types, preferably alongside a Ground-type in order to safely check Zekrom. Ferrothorn handles Electric-types and most Grass Arceus effectively. Lastly, Shadow Tag users, namely Mega Gengar, appreciate being sent in via Volt Switch, making them excellent teammates as well.</p>\n"
