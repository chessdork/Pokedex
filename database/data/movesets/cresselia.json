     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Despite wishing that it just had a little bit more to work with, Cresselia can utilize an effective defensive set with its unique movepool. Moonlight is used as the primary healing move and as such will be used a lot of the time. It is important to note that Moonlight has its shortcomings; it heals less health in sand and rain and has limited PP. Because of this, it should not be used excessively. Psychic is the main STAB move and allows Cresselia to chip down opponents and hit Fighting-types super effectively. Despite its slight nerf, Hidden Power Fire can also work well in this slot. Not only does it dispose of defensive Ferrothorn, but it also gives Cresselia a way to get past Scizor. Ice Beam rounds off the coverage and is a superb move for hitting physically based Dragon-types, Pokemon that Cresselia will often need to wall. Cresselia's final moveslot is dedicated to a status move best fit to the team. Toxic allows Cresselia to spread residual damage and slowly defeat Pokemon, whereas Thunder Wave is best fit for teams that have enough offensive firepower to finish off slower threats. However, Thunder Wave is inferior to Toxic when the team has enough defense to stall Pokemon out. Reflect is an option over either of the moves and enhances Cresselia's ability to take physical hits, allowing it to escape Pursuit more easily and can be used to support teammates.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The EVs are maximized in Defense so that Cresselia can wall powerful physical attackers such as Garchomp, Terrakion, and Landorus-T. A Bold nature is chosen for the same reason, and the rest of the EVs are placed into Cresselia's Special Defense. Leftovers is a standard item for a wall such as Cresselia, providing a means of residual recovery or negating weather damage. In order to perform its role as a physical wall properly, straying from this item choice is not recommended. If one chooses to run Hidden Power Fire, an IV spread of 0 Atk / 30 SpA / 30 Spe achieves the required Hidden Power type while minimizing Foul Play and confusion damage.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This Cresselia set aims to fulfill the role of a mixed wall with a primary focus on Defense. Because of this, Cresselia is best brought in to check physical attackers or Pokemon that it can efficiently stop. It is best to keep Cresselia as healthy as possible and mainly bring it in on Pokemon that are incapable of bypassing its ridiculous defensive limits. Cresselia can be used at essentially any time in the match, depending on what opponents opt to bring out themselves. However, it is a good idea to scout opposing sets to see what Cresselia can and can't handle. For example, because it is particularly vulnerable to being poisoned, Cresselia is best leaving more defensively inclined Pokemon (which can potentially run Toxic) for teammates to deal with. Because Cresselia can also force many switches, setting up hazards before using it to stall out Pokemon is a good idea so that you can take advantage of the entry hazard damage.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>If it hasn't been made clear already, Cresselia loathes Toxic. This makes Pokemon equipped with Heal Bell or Aromatherapy particularly good partners. Chansey can carry either of these moves and also makes an excellent defensive partner, being immune to Cresselia's Ghost-type weakness and taking special hits more capably. Cresselia reciprocates this support by having a resistance to Fighting-type moves. Other Pokemon commonly seen on stall teams are also great teammates for their ability to set hazards and wall the Pokemon that Cresselia cannot. Heatran is a great teammate for Cresselia because it can take care of Volcarona and Scizor, the tier's premier Bug-types. Drought support boosts Moonlight's effect while also getting rid of opposing weather. More specifically, Mega Charizard Y makes a good partner, as it sets up Drought and can take advantage of Thunder Wave support. Another excellent teammate on sun teams is Dugtrio, which can dispose of two great threats to both sun and Cresselia: Heatran and Tyranitar.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Light Screen and Reflect halve damage from special and physical attacks respectively, and are great support for setup sweepers.

The remaining EVs are used for mixed bulk, as Cresselia needs to be able to take some hits while setting up screens. Light Clay is used so Reflect and Light Screen have a duration of eight turns instead of five turns.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This set is very straightforward to use. Set up both screens and use Thunder Wave on the opponent, or just use Lunar Dance if Cresselia is weakened to fully recover a weakened teammate. Be aware of that this set can be setup bait, especially against sweepers with Substitute that can escape Thunder Wave.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>The dual screens set works especially well on offensive teams with many setup sweepers. Use teammates that appreciate dual screen support, namely setup sweepers and Baton Pass users such as Slurpuff, Omastar, Barbarcle, Combusken, and Gorebyss. Other dual screens users are also appreciated to lessen the pressure on Cresselia to keep setting them up; Meowstic-M and Uxie are both good options.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Thanks to Cresselia's enormous bulk, setting up Reflect and Light Screen multiple times throughout a match is a simple task. Reflect and Light Screen are used with the intent of supporting teammates and, more specifically, allowing frail offensive Pokemon to set up with extra protection from incoming attacks. Lunar Dance is the key move that separates Cresselia from other dual screen users, allowing Cresselia to give Pokemon a second chance to sweep. It also allows Cresselia to make use of itself after it has done its main job and avoid being dead weight on the team. It is notable that Lunar Dance also cures status ailments and can revive Pokemon that would otherwise fall from entry hazard damage upon returning to the field. Thunder Wave is used to support teammates by crippling Pokemon that attempt to break through Cresselia and can be used if Cresselia is slower than the Pokemon it is trying to set up dual screens on.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Light Clay is a straightforward item choice, extending the length of Cresselia's Reflect and Light Screen in order to maximize the time a teammate can set up. With Reflect activated, the given EVs allow Cresselia to survive two Crunches from Choice Band Tyranitar after Stealth Rock. The EV spread also lets Cresselia outspeed Adamant Bisharp and Modest Politoed with maximum Speed investment, thus giving Cresselia more opportunities to set up dual screens. By having 248 EVs in HP, Cresselia hits a Stealth Rock number and thus loses less health from residual damage.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Cresselia is brought in before a sweeper to set up dual screens when it is convenient in order to prepare the field conditions. Reflect and Light Screen in conjunction allow formerly paper-thin sweepers to gain precious turns to accumulate boosts, and Cresselia needs to set these up before said sweepers can jump into the fray. It is often recommended to use Reflect before Light Screen, as most switch-ins to Cresselia tend to be physically oriented. After it has set up screens, spreading status through Thunder Wave is an excellent way to make use of Cresselia, especially when it is not appropriate to switch directly into a teammate. It is also useful to paralyze opponents before activating the dual screens so that teammates can make the most out of the limited turns that they have. In some matches, Cresselia will be able to set up screens multiple times. When this happens, it is often best to do this and then, when Cresselia's health depletes too much, use Lunar Dance to revive a teammate.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>This particular Cresselia set provides excellent support for frail setup sweepers; Volcarona, Thundurus, Manaphy, and Lucario can all employ dual screens to effectively boost their offensive stats while being able to simultaneously sponge incoming attacks. Most of Cresselia's best teammates are backed up by superb coverage and power, only lacking the defensive prowess to boost under normal circumstances. Because of Cresselia's access to Lunar Dance, these setup sweepers are also capable of being given a second chance. Notably, Lunar Dance renews Dragonite's Multiscale, and therefore makes it an excellent partner. Less immediately threatening and more defensive boosters, such as Suicune and Reuniclus, can also exploit the benefits of dual screens to acquire their essential starting boosts.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Substitute is used to make Cresselia less vulnerable to status ailments such as poison, letting it beat walls like Alomomola, and eases prediction. Calm Mind is Cresselia's setup move, and after a few boosts, Cresselia can perform a sweep if its counters are either gone or weakened. Moonblast is the preferred attacking move because it has zero immunities as opposed to Psyshock, also hitting Dark-types such as Spiritomb and Drapion. Moonlight is used for instant recovery and makes it easier for Cresselia to set up Calm Minds. Psyshock can be used instead of Moonlight if you have a teammate that deals with Skuntank, Drapion, and Registeel, such as Dugtrio. Psyshock also gets STAB, and so hits harder than Moonblast, while also allowing Cresselia to beat opposing Calm Mind users.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>252 HP and 172 Defense EVs are used to improve Cresselia's physical bulk. Special Defense EVs are not needed as Cresselia can use Calm Mind, which boosts its Special Defense by one stage. 84 Speed EVs are used to let Cresselia outspeed and beat threats such as Drapion that do not have Speed investment.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Do not attempt to sweep before Cresselia's counters are either gone or weakened; as such, a Calm Mind sweep should not be attempted until late-game. Use Calm Mind against offensively weaker opponents, such as walls or support-oriented Pokemon, and recover with Moonlight. Watch out for status aliments, namely poison and paralysis, as both of them can stop Cresselia's sweep, so don't be afraid of using Substitute often.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Moltres is a great partner for Cresselia, as it deals with one of the best counters to Cresselia, Escavalier. Cresselia also deeply appreciates teammates that take care of offensive Dark-types such as Sharpedo; Aromatisse is a good option. Destiny Bond + Nasty Plot Mismagius is a great partner for Cresselia, as it easily lures out and KOes Drapion, Skuntank, and other Dark-types; it can also weaken more defensive threats, making a sweep for Cresselia much easier. Fast and strong Pokemon with U-turn or Volt Switch are also appreciated by Cresselia. Once they have weakened the opposing team's wall, these Pokemon can pivot into Cresselia, which then can set up with ease and start sweeping. Wallbreakers such as Clawitzer and Exploud can wear down defensive cores, meaning Cresselia won't need as many Calm Minds to perform a sweep.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Psyshock is Cresselia's STAB move that OHKOes less bulky Fighting-types such as Hitmonlee, which often pack Knock Off. Moonblast is used for coverage and hits Dark-types, which are immune to Psyshock, for super effective damage. Moonlight is instant recovery which is mandatory on a wall. Unfortunately, Moonlight only has 8 PP, which means that Cresselia can easily get PP stalled, so don't use Moonlight unless it's necessary. Thunder Wave is used to cripple the opponent and to make sweeps for teammates easier. Toxic can also be used, but Toxic stall is hard due to Moonlight lacking enough PP to stall with. Lunar Dance is also an option, as after Cresselia has walled what it needs to, completely restoring a teammate's health and PP is really appreciated on offensive teams. Hidden Power Fire can be used for Escavalier and Durant.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>252 HP EVs are used to maximize mixed bulk, making Cresselia both physically and specially defensive. 152 Defense EVs and a Bold nature allow Cresselia to avoid a 2HKO from Adamant Hitmonlee's Life Orb-boosted Knock Off after Stealth Rock. Cresselia can then just recover HP with Moonlight, which means that Cresselia effectively counters Hitmonlee. The remaining EVs are used in Special Defense to further bolster Cresselia's special bulk. Leftovers is used for a small amount of recovery each turn.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Cresselia works really well as a bulky pivot and a tank due to its great bulk. Use Cresselia to wall what your team needs to wall, and try and cripple as many of the opponent's Pokemon as possible with either Thunder Wave or Toxic. Watch out for Pursuit trappers, however, as they can easily give Cresselia trouble.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Aromatisse has good defensive synergy with Cresselia as it resists Bug- and Dark-type moves that Cresselia fears. Alomomola can also be used, as it deals with most Dark- and Bug-types while also walling Escavalier. Moltres is also a great teammate for Cresselia, and can easily deal with Escavalier. Slower powerhouses love Thunder Wave support, such as Clawitzer, Exploud, and Emboar. Moltres and Substitute + Bulk Up Braviary can also Toxic stall weaker opponents thanks to Cresselia's Toxic.</p>\n"
