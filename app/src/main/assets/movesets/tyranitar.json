     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>A speedy Pursuit allows Tyranitar to checkmate Gengar, Starmie, Latias, and Latios, hitting them before they can retaliate. Crunch provides it with a backup Dark-type STAB move to hit bulkier Pokemon such as Slowbro. Earthquake hits Lucario, Heatran, Bisharp, and Excadrill harder than any other move on Tyranitar's set does. Stone Edge rounds out the set by giving Tyranitar a Rock-type STAB move to revenge kill dangerous sweepers such as Mega Pinsir, Mega Charizard Y, Mega Charizard X, and Talonflame. Tyranitar's decent special movepool gives it a few other options to choose from. Ice Beam can surprise unsuspecting Landorus-T and Gliscor, which would otherwise easily switch into this set, and allows Tyranitar to revenge kill Garchomp and Landorus. Fire Blast is another alternative move that fries bulky Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory, which take little damage from both of Tyranitar's STAB moves. If Terrakion and opposing Tyranitar are of concern, Superpower is also an option.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>With maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature, Tyranitar is able to outspeed positive natured base 115s and below, putting it above a decent portion of the metagame. The rest of the EVs are dumped into its Attack stat in order for it to hit as hard as possible.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Choice Scarf Tyranitar is one of the best Pursuit trappers in the game, as it's able to outspeed every common Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon in the tier. Unlike its other sets, Gengar and Starmie cannot deal heavy damage to Choice Scarf Tyranitar without being taken out by Pursuit. Keep in mind that even with a Choice Scarf, Tyranitar is still outsped by key Pokemon such as Alakazam, Tornadus-T, and Greninja, all of which can easily 2HKO it with their coverage moves.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Tyranitar pairs well with Pokemon that appreciate the lack of Ghost- and Psychic-types. Keldeo and Landorus, in particular, struggle to break through Latias and Latios, and can plow through opposing teams much more easily with them gone. Tyranitar itself needs a Pokemon to deal with Fighting-types; Mega Pinsir and Talonflame can check the majority of them with their priority Flying-type attacks. Mega Venusaur has great defensive synergy with Tyranitar, as it is able to switch into Fighting-, Fairy-, and Water-type attacks with ease. As with most of its sets, Tyranitar appreciates being able to switch in frequently, so pairing it with a spinner such as Excadrill or a Defog user such as Skarmory is highly recommended.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Dragon Dance turns Mega Tyranitar into one of the most powerful sweepers in the metagame, capable of plowing through offensive and defensive teams alike. After one Dragon Dance, Tyranitar hits a whopping 640 Attack and 397 Speed, giving it an insane amount of power to work with, along with enough Speed to outpace most of the unboosted metagame. Stone Edge is Mega Tyranitar's STAB move of choice, as after a boost, the move can OHKO pretty much anything that doesn't resist it as well as easily OHKO physically defensive Mandibuzz. Ice Punch provides Mega Tyranitar with a important coverage move to hit some of its common checks and counters really hard, such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Garchomp, as well as deal solid damage to Hippowdon. Fire Punch is usable over Ice Punch or Earthquake to OHKO Scizor and Ferrothorn at +1, but Stone Edge already hits Scizor hard enough, and hitting Ferrothorn isn't really worth giving up the extra coverage that Earthquake provides. Earthquake covers Lucario, Bisharp, Terrakion, Excadrill, opposing Tyranitar, weakened Keldeo, and Heatran. Crunch is a powerful Dark-type STAB move that hits Slowbro harder than any other move and is much more accurate; however, running it over Stone Edge means that Mega Tyranitar will struggle to break through a lot more Pokemon, such as Unaware Clefable, Bulk Up Talonflame, Rotom-W, and Azumarill.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment with a Jolly nature are so that Mega Tyranitar can hit as hard as possible while being able to outspeed everything relevant. Tyranitarite allows Tyranitar to Mega Evolve, boosting its Attack, Defense, Special Defense, and Speed stats. Although an Adamant nature might seem tempting for the incredible boost in power it provides, Mega Tyranitar will miss out on outspeeding key Pokemon such as Adamant Bisharp before a boost and Greninja at +1.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Aside from the obvious fact that Mega Tyranitar has higher Attack and Speed stats, its buffed defenses are an incredible asset to it as well. It's so bulky, in fact, that it only takes 66.66 - 78.94% from Choice Band Scizor's Bullet Punch and 66.9 - 79.8% from Life Orb Greninja's Hydro Pump in sand. This gives Mega Tyranitar the ability to set up on most Pokemon that lack a powerful super effective move to hit it with, as well as a few that do, such as Kyurem-B, Mega Pinsir, and even Garchomp. Even with this extra bulk, it isn't recommended for Mega Tyranitar to set up when its checks are still present, as most of its common checks can severely cripple it or put it in range of powerful priority attacks. Still, keep in mind that Mega Tyranitar can survive most forms of priority moves at least once at full health.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Common offensive Pokemon such as Mamoswine, Excadrill, Terrakion, Lucario, Scizor, Keldeo, and Conkeldurr all threaten to deal massive damage to Mega Tyranitar and prevent it from setting up and sweeping. Talonflame can handle most of the Fighting-types in the tier with its priority Brave Bird, and can soften up physical walls so that Mega Tyranitar has an easier time sweeping. Mega Tyranitar fits very well on offensive teams with powerful wallbreakers that can break its common checks and counters. Keldeo is an amazing wallbreaker that can easily break through Landorus-T, Skarmory, Hippowdon, and Gliscor, which are great checks to Mega Tyranitar. Scizor can check Clefable and Azumarill, which threaten to stop Mega Tyranitar from sweeping. Entry hazards are very important in securing specific OHKOs at +1, such as on Gliscor and Scizor. Landorus or Terrakion is usually the best fit for deploying hazards, as they both fit very well on the offensive teams that Mega Tyranitar is usually on. Furthermore, they are nearly guaranteed to get up Stealth Rock.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Because of Tyranitar's incredible bulk and useful resistances to Flying-, Fire-, and Dark-type moves, it's easily one of the most reliable users of Stealth Rock in the tier. However, if another Pokemon on your team is already running Stealth Rock, Fire Blast is a fine alternative to KO bulky Steel-types, such as Skarmory, Scizor, and Ferrothorn, that Tyranitar lures out. Crunch is Tyranitar's Dark-type STAB move of choice, and hits Psychic-types such as Latias and Latios as well as Gengar. Ice Beam keeps Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Hippowdon from completely walling Tyranitar and prevents Garchomp from switching in freely. Earthquake hits Lucario, Heatran, Bisharp, and Excadrill hard. Stone Edge can be used as a Rock-type STAB move to OHKO Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Pinsir. Pursuit can be used to trap Psychic-types such as Latios and Latias, but it's very weak without Attack investment, and Tyranitar prefers the extra coverage from Ice Beam.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Full physical investment with a positive nature in conjunction with its enormous sand-enhanced Special Defense makes Tyranitar one of the bulkiest mixed walls in the game. Leftovers is the preferred item for extra, much-needed longevity that Tyranitar does not otherwise possess due to its lack of reliable recovery. Smooth Rock allows sand to be up for eight turns instead of five, as Tyranitar pairs very well with Sand Rush Excadrill. An Assault Vest can be used if you want Tyranitar to be an even better mixed wall, but it'll have to forgo the ability to run Stealth Rock and will greatly miss out on Leftovers recovery. Tyranitarite allows Tyranitar to Mega Evolve and obtain a significant boost to its stats, but uses up your team's Mega slot and comes at the cost of the passive recovery from Leftovers, making it easier to wear down. Chople Berry allows Tyranitar to take less damage from Mega Charizard Y's Focus Blast in the sun, allowing Tyranitar to tank a hit and deal heavy damage in return.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Tyranitar's massive Special Defense stat and impressive physical bulk make it a perfect contender for a support set. Its useful Rock typing gives it key resistances to common Flying- and Fire-type moves, which are seen on common threats such as Talonflame, Mega Pinsir, Heatran, and Mega Charizard X. This set is best used on teams in need of a reliable user of Stealth Rock and a check to the aforementioned physical threats. Although it's not nearly as sturdy as Hippowdon, Tyranitar still does a very good job at keeping sand up due to its insane amount of bulk. Tyranitar has the advantage of having more offensive presence than Hippowdon, making it a better fit for more offensively based teams. Keep in mind that Tyranitar can be worn down relatively easily due to its lack of reliable recovery, so it's important to switch it in sparingly.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Tyranitar is completely shut down by most Fighting-types, so pairing it with teammates that can both check and counter them is essential. Talonflame checks all Fighting-types with priority Brave Bird and can roast Steel-types with Flare Blitz. Landorus-T checks Scizor and can provide Tyranitar with free switch-ins thanks to U-turn. Keldeo, Mega Charizard Y, and Landorus are great offensive partners because Tyranitar puts a lot of pressure on Latias and Latios. Finally, keeping entry hazards off the field is essential in keeping Tyranitar healthy. Skarmory has great defensive synergy with Tyranitar and can use Defog to clear away entry hazards. Excadrill can utilize its Sand Rush ability to outrun virtually the entire tier when paired with Tyranitar and has access to Rapid Spin, making them great partners.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Stealth Rock is a mandatory choice seeing as Tyranitar is one of the move's few good users, being able to set it up against common Pokemon it checks, such as Yveltal and Ho-Oh. Pursuit is a big part of what gives Tyranitar its niche, allowing it to trap Mega Gengar, Mega Mewtwo Y, Choice Scarf Kyogre locked into Ice Beam/Thunder, and Ho-Oh that decide it is in their best interest to flee. This is essentially a mandatory move on stall teams because of how huge a threat stallbreakers like Mega Gengar are on these teams, and being able to guarantee the removal of these threats is invaluable. If one wishes, Toxic is a great alternative to use in this slot for putting support Arceus on a timer, letting Tyranitar beat certain Calm Mind Arceus formes and bothering bulky Pokemon in general. Using both Pursuit and Payback is not 100% necessary to keep Pokemon like Mega Gengar and Mega Mewtwo Y in check. If the targets of Pursuit have Fighting-type coverage, such as Mega Gengar with Focus Blast, they will more than likely use it; Tyranitar can stomach the hit with a Chople Berry and use Payback for the KO. If they do not run Fighting coverage, they will attempt to switch out, but then they cannot harm Tyranitar anyway, meaning that it can switch in on them repeatedly later in the game as a regular check would.</p>\n<p>Moving on, Stone Edge hits Ho-Oh and Yveltal super effectively and is Tyranitar's most hard-hitting STAB move. Low Kick punishes Extreme Killer Arceus for setting up on Tyranitar and hits notable targets Dark/Rock Arceus, Heatran, and Dialga super effectively. Superpower is an alternative that hits Darkrai harder and is great in conjunction with a Lum Berry. Payback works well with Tyranitar's poor Speed and provides a consistent Dark-type STAB move. It also allows for mindgames in tandem with Pursuit. Crunch is another option that proves situationally more useful against slower Pokemon like Bronzong, and has a moderately high 30% chance of lowering the opponent's Defense. However, using it notably leaves Tyranitar unable to guarantee bringing 252 HP Deoxys-S down to sandstorm KO range (it requires 84 Attack EVs and an Adamant nature to do so). This makes it a suboptimal option as one of Tyranitar's main niches is anti-leading Deoxys-S leads. Finally, if one's team so requires, Ice Beam can be fit on this set to hit Ground-types, notably smacking Landorus-T and Gliscor for 4x damage (it does not OHKO them even with a Sassy nature, though). It works especially well in tandem with a Shuca Berry. Taunt is useful for preventing opponents from using Defog and status moves, but Tyranitar is generally too slow to use the move effectively outside of hitting predicted switch-ins of Pokemon such as support Arceus formes.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Maximum HP and Special Defense EVs with a Careful nature are used maximize Tyranitar's special bulk; this also makes full use of the 1.5x Special Defense boost sandstorm provides. Investing 24 EVs in Attack lets Stone Edge OHKO 4 HP / 0 Def Yveltal after Stealth Rock, so consider siphoning these EVs from Special Defense into Attack. Chople Berry lets Tyranitar trap Gengar and Mega Mewtwo Y regardless of whether they have Fighting-type coverage. Pursuit should always be used with Chople Berry. Note that Tyranitar's 4x weakness to Fighting-type moves mean that Chople Berry will be doing little in the way of cushioning it from physical Fighting-type attacks, especially STAB ones. Moving on, Tyranitarite is a good item to use. Mega Tyranitar boasts increased all-around stats over regular Tyranitar; notably, the added Defense allows it to better check physical threats like Extreme Killer Arceus and Landorus-T, taking one of their hits and retaliating with the appropriate move. However, it must be emphasized that the opportunity cost of using Tyranitarite is that takes up your team's Mega Evolution slot.</p>\n<p>If Tyranitarite cannot be used due to teambuilding constraints, Leftovers is a perfectly viable alternative. It gives Tyranitar a little more wiggle room in switching in and can prove very useful in letting Tyranitar survive longer matches and set up Stealth Rock multiple times. Lum Berry is good for letting Tyranitar shrug off status on a single occasion, such as a Sacred Fire burn or Darkrai's Dark Void. Lastly, Shuca Berry is a possible alternative item that allows Tyranitar to take an Earthquake from weakened Groudon/Landorus-T/Gliscor and possibly pick them off (if it is used, Ice Beam snipes the latter two and does significant damage to the former).</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Tyranitar has no reliable recovery; keep this in mind when making switches as it will gradually be worn down. Also, Tyranitar is easily exploited because of its poor Speed and many weaknesses; be careful about staying in if Pokemon like Blaziken/Mega Mewtwo X are present on the opposing team unless you are intending to cripple them on the predicted switch-in. Also be careful of predicted double switches into these threats. On the other hand, don't be excessively conservative. For example, if the opponent's Kyogre has been found to be Choiced and the Ice Beam/Thunder is imminent, switching Tyranitar in to Pursuit it would be nice. If you see Mega Gengar/Mega Mewtwo Y, keep Tyranitar healthy as you need to be healthy to reliably trap these. Lead with Tyranitar against Deoxys-S (Deoxys-A if running Chople Berry, as 0 Atk Low Kick from Deoxys-A does not KO) and Scolipede leads. It is pretty good anti-lead to these suicide leads in conjunction with sand. Speaking of which, when sand is active, don't underestimate Tyranitar's special bulk. It can and should stay in to take moderately powerful special attacks if it means wearing down the opponent to a level where they can be easily picked off with the aid of residual damage from status and sand. For example, a neutral 4 SpA Judgment from a support Arceus does a paltry 18%-22% to Tyranitar, which is further mitigated by Leftovers recovery. Even a super effective Judgment is merely a 3HKO on Tyranitar factoring in Leftovers recovery, so keep that in mind when deciding if it is in your best interest to stay in. Finally, note that Tyranitar can function as an effective lure with the appropriate item/move (see Other Options for suggestions).</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Cleric support is highly recommended because of how status-prone Tyranitar is. Fairy-types are good partners, offering good defensive synergy and appreciating Pursuit support against Mega Gengar. Wish support is also nice as Tyranitar lacks reliable recovery. Sylveon and Blissey are great partners that provide both Wish and Heal Beal support. Jirachi is another solid partner that helps against Fairy-types while Tyranitar checks Yveltal and Ho-Oh for it; however, it compounds a nasty Ground-type weakness. Flying-type teammates or Pokemon with Levitate are recommended to check Earthquake spam, and also mitigate the team's Fighting-type weakness. Scizor is a good teammate to check Fairy-types, as is Bronzong (again, try not to compound the Ground weakness)</p>\n<p>A Kyogre check is required; Grass Arceus is a good one, having excellent synergy with Tyranitar. It also checks Palkia and Groudon. That said, Palkia is also a good Kyogre check. On dedicated stall teams, having two decent answers to Kyogre as also an option, for example, using Water Arceus and Ferrothorn. Palkia is another problem; support Arceus formes that fare well against it are good partners that can provide entry hazard removal as well. Ghost Arceus is a particularly good partner to handle Fighting-types and Mega Kangaskhan, while Tyranitar helps it with Ho-Oh and Yveltal. Finally, sweepers are good teammates to take advantage of Tyranitar's Pursuit-trapping utility. Sand Rush Excadrill is also a naturally good partner.</p>\n"
