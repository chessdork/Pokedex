     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Power Whip is for bulky Water-types such as Politoed, Rotom-W, and Jellicent, also hitting other common threats like Tyranitar and Mamoswine. Gyro Ball makes Ferrothorn an excellent answer to powerful Fairy-types such as Mega Gardevoir, Togekiss, and Sylveon whilst also assuring consistent damage on the faster threats in the metagame, cleanly 2HKOing Garchomp and Latios. Thunder Wave is an alternative option which Ferrothorn can utilize well thanks to its great bulk, allowing it to spread paralysis and also cripple common switch-ins. Leech Seed improves Ferrothorn's longevity whilst also dealing consistent chip damage and forcing switches. It also helps Ferrothorn stall out opposing Trick Room teams as most Trick Room setters and users are bulky, meaning Ferrothorn often gains a significant amount of health from Leech Seed. Protect allows Ferrothorn to scout enemy attacks and also steal more HP through Leech Seed. It also gives Ferrothorn a turn to avoid any damage whilst its partner handles a threat that it may struggle with.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>172 Attack EVs ensure Ferrothorn can OHKO both Rotom-W and Jellicent with Power Whip. It also means Gyro Ball will OHKO 252 HP / 0 Def Togekiss under Tailwind. The remaining EVs are put into Defense so Ferrothorn can tank physical hits better. A Brave nature is used to help Ferrothorn perform better as a Trick Room check and power up its Gyro Ball. 0 Speed IVs are used for the same reason. Players using Thunder Wave and Gyro Ball on the same set should be wary of the fact that Gyro Ball's power is based on how much slower Ferrothorn is than the opponent. Lum Berry is the preferred item as it lets Ferrothorn absorb a burn from Rotom-W or Jellicent before OHKOing with Power Whip in return. It also allows Ferrothorn to easily handle Thunder Wave Togekiss, which can be very obtrusive. A Rocky Helmet can be used to help rack up easy damage and discourage the use of Fake Out. 252 Attack EVs can be used for Gyro Ball to OHKO Latios (after Life Orb damage) and Tornadus. A specially defensive EV spread of 252 HP / 48 Def / 208 SpD with a Relaxed nature is also usable; with this spread, Ferrothorn can take three Ice Beams from Modest Kyurem-B.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Ferrothorn is easy to switch into a multitude of physical threats and can even get chip damage off through Iron Barbs; for instance by switching into a Fake Out from Pokemon such as Mega Kangakhan or Hitmontop. Through the use of Leech Seed and Protect, Ferrothorn can stall out Trick Room with ease. In addition to this, it can handle Trick Room threats such as Rhyperior and Sylveon with its low Speed and powerful STAB moves. Ferrothorn is also a good lure for Jellicent and Rotom-W; it can absorb a burn with Lum Berry and then OHKO with Power Whip.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Chandelure makes a good teammate for Ferrothorn as it can absorb any Fire-type attacks with Flash Fire while being immune to the Fighting-type attacks that threaten Ferrothorn. Heatran is a bulkier Flash Fire user, but it shares a Fighting-type weakness with Ferrothorn. Trick Room-setting partners such as Cresselia can ensure Ferrothorn moves first and thus help it to avoid taking hits from any threats it can OHKO. Politoed can provide rain support to lessen Ferrothorn's Fire-type weakness; it also handles Fire-type Pokemon such as Heatran. Fighting-type Pokemon blast through the Steel-types that Ferrothorn struggles to break through. Terrakion is a good choice because it also resists the Fire-type moves that Ferrothorn fears. Tyranitar can remove sun and provide additional chip damage by setting up sand.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Ferrothorn is a very reliable user of Stealth Rock, as its typing and bulk can force many Pokemon to switch out. Leech Seed is extremely valuable, giving Ferrothorn a much-needed source of recovery as well as a great phazing tool against Pokemon that attempt to set up on it. Power Whip's very high Base Power compensates for the lack of Attack investment, and it allows Ferrothorn to beat many Water- and Ground-types. Protect allows Ferrothorn to recover more health from Leftovers and Leech Seed as well as to scout for potential coverage moves, such as Fire Blast from Tyranitar and Garchomp and Superpower from Azumarill. Gyro Ball is another powerful STAB move that uses Ferrothorn's ridiculously low Speed to its advantage, allowing it to check Pokemon such as Dragonite and Kyurem-B more easily. Unfortunately, its low PP is a potential issue. Knock Off is an alternative attacking option in the last slot that pesters switch-ins by robbing them of their items.</p>\n<p>Two other moves can be used. Running Spikes instead of Stealth Rock is viable if Ferrothorn is already paired with a Stealth Rock user. Thunder Wave is great for crippling switch-ins that rely on their Speed, such as Charizard. It should be noted that Thunder Wave should never be used alongside Gyro Ball, as the Speed drop from paralysis drastically lowers Gyro Ball's power.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The given EV spread allows Ferrothorn to fare well against both physically and specially based opponents. Specifically, an investment of 168 Special Defense EVs allows Ferrothorn to survive two Ice Beams from Manaphy after a Tail Glow. However, Ferrothorn's EV spread can easily be tailored to account for any individual threats it needs to check. For example, a spread of 252 HP / 248 Def / 8 SpD gives Ferrothorn a much easier time against Ground-types, such as Excadrill, Diggersby, and Mamoswine. A Relaxed nature and a Speed IV of 0 should be used with Gyro Ball to increase its damage output.</p>\n<p>Leftovers is the preferred item, as Ferrothorn greatly appreciates the recovery it provides. However, Rocky Helmet can be used to punish users of contact moves even more than usual. Speaking of contact moves, Iron Barbs is the only ability worth considering&mdash;Anticipation is generally only useful to scout for Fire-type coverage moves, which can already be accomplished by Protect.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Ferrothorn should initially be switched in on a Pokemon that does not threaten it, such as a Water-type or Chansey, and proceed to set up Stealth Rock. Afterwards, it can serve as a utility counter to most Water-types, some Electric-types, and many other select Pokemon such as Kyurem-B if it has the appropriate move. Generally, throwing out a Leech Seed is a safe option; most teams lack a Pokemon immune to the move, and Ferrothorn will lose some HP when it switches in most of the time. Aside from this, using Ferrothorn effectively depends on the moves it's running. For example, Protect can be used to scout an opposing Greninja's moveset for Hidden Power Fire.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>An important thing to keep in mind about Ferrothorn is that it excels on teams that take advantage of weather. An immunity to sandstorm damage and the ability to counter Water-types make Ferrothorn a great fit on sand teams, where Hippowdon is a fantastic teammate. Hippowdon can check the Fire- and Fighting-types that Ferrothorn struggles against, and it can also use Stealth Rock, which frees up a moveslot for Ferrothorn. Similarly, rain partially alleviates Ferrothorn's crippling Fire-type weakness, and rain teams often struggle against the Water- and Electric-types that Ferrothorn checks with ease. Thus, Politoed is another good partner for Ferrothorn. Bisharp and Defiant Thundurus can capitalize on the use of Defog, which Ferrothorn's entry hazards often force. Landorus-T works similarly to Hippowdon, checking Fire- and Fighting-types. Gyarados and Azumarill also work well in this regard. Finally, Fairy-types such as Clefable and Sylveon check Fighting-types, and the latter can assist Ferrothorn with Wish and Heal Bell.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>This set utilizes Ferrothorn's stellar 74 / 131 / 116 defensive stats and its variety of support options to check critical threats and provide general support to its team. Gyro Ball is a must for Ferrothorn as it 2HKOes Mega Gengar, a top threat in the metagame, preventing Ferrothorn from becoming fodder. Gyro Ball is a fairly reliable STAB move, and due to Ferrothorn's pathetic base 20 Speed, it usually strikes with its maximum Base Power of 150, 2HKOing Xerneas and smashing speedy threats such as Mega Mewtwo Y and Darkrai. Leech Seed chips away at an opposing Pokemon's HP and heals Ferrothorn in the process, allowing it to stall out threats and tank attacks for a longer period of time. As an added bonus, Leech Seed also allows Ferrothorn to check offensive variants of Kyogre. Though Leech Seed provides semi-reliable recovery, it cannot heal status conditions, does not affect Grass-types, and is cleared when the inflicted Pokemon switches out. Therefore, Rest is a viable alternative to Leech Seed, as it makes Ferrothorn more self-sufficient, fully restores its HP, and removes harmful status conditions such as burns, which severely inhibit Ferrothorn's defensive capabilities. In conjunction with Toxic, Rest also allows Ferrothorn to potentially stall out Defog users, as Lugia cannot damage it significantly, and most support Arceus formes can only use Will-O-Wisp and weak Judgments to hurt it. However, using Rest puts Ferrothorn to sleep, leaving it vulnerable for two turns, and cannot be used to damage opposing Pokemon.</p>\n<p>Toxic gives Ferrothorn the ability to cripple common switch-ins such as Ho-Oh and support Arceus formes, as well as place setup sweepers on a timer. Toxic damage compounds with Leech Seed damage and can be used to stall out opposing Pokemon. Toxic cripples Defog users so Ferrothorn can stay in on them and continuously replace the entry hazards lost to Defog. Power Whip can be used as a secondary STAB option, as it allows Ferrothorn to serve as a competent check to non-Choice Specs Kyogre. With its excellent bulk, Ferrothorn is able to repeatedly lay down entry hazards, which hinder the opposing team and punish switches with residual damage. Notably, it fairs better against Defog users than most other entry hazard setters, as it can cripple them with status moves. Spikes is the primary entry hazard as it has fairly limited distribution, as Stealth Rock can be run on a teammate. However, Spikes takes longer to set up and is therefore more vulnerable to Defog. Stealth Rock is a solid alternative, as it punishes a greater variety of threats than Spikes does, requires only one turn to set up, and is crucial in limiting the number of times Ho-Oh can switch in.</p>\n<p>Protect is an alternative option, as it allows Ferrothorn to scout for dangerous moves, benefit from passive recovery, and rack up Toxic and/or Leech Seed damage. The move can be exploited though, as it can give the opponent a free turn to switch to a Pokemon that threatens Ferrothorn, removing the effects of Leech Seed and resetting Toxic counters in the process. Knock Off can also provide additional utility, as it can remove the items of many targets. However, it can be difficult to fit Knock Off on Ferrothorn's moveset, and the move is mostly useless against Mega Evolutions and Arceus formes. Although having access to multiple support moves works in Ferrothorn's favor, the unfortunate truth is that it suffers from four-moveslot syndrome, as it is unable to fit all the moves it wants on a single set.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Iron Barbs is the chosen ability for the residual damage it provides on physical attackers that utilize contact moves. The ability also helps to punish weaker U-turns used by Pokemon such as Landorus-T. Leftovers is the optimal item choice for Ferrothorn, as the HP regeneration provided by Leftovers and Leech Seed is too good to pass up. A Sassy nature boosts Ferrothorn's special bulk and, along with running no Speed IVs, strengthens the power of Gyro Ball. The current EV spread maximizes Ferrothorn's special bulk, allowing it to check the multitude of special attackers in the tier as effectively as possible. Although investing in Special Defense is vastly superior, Ferrothorn has the option of investing in Defense, making it more efficient against physical attackers, such as Mega Kangaskhan. Furthermore, it can serve as a backup check to certain variants of Extreme Killer Arceus, as with defensive investment, it avoids the 2HKO from a boosted Lum Berry Adamant Extreme Killer Arceus's Earthquake. The four leftover EVs are placed into Attack to provide a slight buff to Ferrothorn's physical moves.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Ferrothorn can function as a good check to a variety of top threats, tanking hits and slowly wearing them down with Leech Seed and Toxic. Ferrothorn cannot take hits from Kyogre with Choice Specs or multiple Calm Mind boosts, but is otherwise a solid check to the leviathan as it is only 3HKOed by Modest Kyogre's full-powered Water Spout. Ferrothorn can serve as a decent one-time check to unboosted Xerneas, as it can land a 2HKO with Gyro Ball. However, Ferrothorn should not switch in on a boosted Xerneas unless you are certain that it does not carry Focus Blast or Hidden Power Fire; both moves can KO Ferrothorn or damage it beyond repair. Ferrothorn can take advantage of Zekrom, setting up entry hazards against it or crippling a switch-in with Toxic. Furthermore, it can stall out Electric Arceus with Toxic fairly easily and check Palkia in rain. Ferrothorn generally beats walls that rely on Toxic to deal damage, such as Aegislash, Chansey, and Blissey, due to the immunity provided by its Steel typing, and it is able to set up entry hazards against them or pester them with Leech Seed. Ferrothorn does not have the ability to function as a pure wall, as it needs significant team support to make up for its flaws, but is a solid entry hazard setter and should be used as such.</p>\n<p>Be cautious when you have Ferrothorn out, as dangerous moves such as Fire Blast and Focus Blast have a very wide distribution. If you have Protect, use it to scout for these moves, but avoid being too obvious when you use Protect\u2014telegraphing the use of the move is almost a surefire way for Ferrothorn to get set up on. Try to catch Pokemon with Leech Seed as they switch in in order to recover HP when you scout the opponent's moves with Protect. Furthermore, if a dangerous move is revealed, the HP drained by Leech Seed will benefit your chosen switch-in. Leech Seed works especially well against Chansey and Blissey due to their enormous HP stats; Ferrothorn also takes negligible net damage from Seismic Toss due to the passive recovery it receives every turn. Against faster threats, keep in mind that Gyro Ball has only eight PP, so Pressure users such as Mewtwo can quickly make it useless. If the opponent has Xerneas and you lack another solid answer to it, make sure you conserve Gyro Ball's PP.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Kyogre is an outstanding partner for Ferrothorn, as although the duration of Drizzle was shortened to five turns, the rain it brings helps mitigate Ferrothorn's weakness to Fire-type moves. In return, Ferrothorn's Spikes help Kyogre secure KOs and wear down its chief check, Palkia. Ferrothorn can readily switch in on Electric- and Grass-type moves aimed at Kyogre and also use Toxic to wear down bulky checks to Kyogre, such as Grass Arceus. Clerics such as Chansey, Blissey, and Xerneas are excellent partners as well, especially for Leech Seed variants of Ferrothorn, which are very susceptible to burns. Clerics are also beneficial for Rest variants, as they can wake Ferrothorn up immediately if it needs to heal, though it should be noted that Ferrothorn is fairly good at finding free turns to wake up on its own. Ferrothorn is incinerated by Fire-type moves, so it can bait these attacks and give Ho-Oh, Kyogre, Heatran, and most Dragon-types an opportunity to switch in. Fairy-types, Ho-Oh, and Giratina can serve as decent partners too, as they can switch in on Fighting-type moves aimed at Ferrothorn and force switches, either through offensive presence or phazing, to rack up entry hazard damage. Ho-Oh is a major threat to Ferrothorn, so a partner such as Rock Arceus that can check it is appreciated. A teammate with access to a speedy Taunt can be helpful in preventing an opponent's Defog from clearing Ferrothorn's precious Spikes, ensuring that it does not set up in vain. Sweepers in general serve as great teammates, as they can use the entry hazards that Ferrothorn sets to secure OHKOs and 2HKOs, and they appreciate Ferrothorn using Toxic to wear down walls they cannot beat alone.</p>\n"
