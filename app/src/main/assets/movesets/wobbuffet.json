     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Wobbuffet's overall movepool is sparse yet simple, making each moveslot option integral to how it functions. Counter and Mirror Coat are obvious staples, as Wobbuffet would not be able to trap and defeat Choice Scarf users without them. Encore can lock the opponent into a useless move, allowing a sweeper to come in and set up without fear of repercussion. Safeguard is very useful as well, as Wobbuffet can lock an opponent into a status move and then render it ineffective, allowing free setup opportunities for sweepers. Destiny Bond can be used over Safeguard to ease prediction against offensive Pokemon, but Wobbuffet loses the ability to help its team set up on status moves and will often have to take a hit before using Destiny Bond due to its horrendous Speed.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The given EV spread allows Wobbuffet to maximize its ability to survive specail attacks while also providing more Leftovers recovery with the 28 EVs invested into HP. The EVs can be tweaked for Wobbuffet to check certain Pokemon, such as investing in Defense for Blaziken and Ho-Oh.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>To increase Wobbuffet's success, it is recommended to seek out targets you wish to revenge kill, primarily to prevent mixed attackers from playing around with Counter and Mirror Coat or possibly to also prevent Choice Band and Choice Specs users from defeating Wobbuffet. When this is done, Choice Scarf users can be spotted as potential targets for Wobbuffet. If the opponent switches frequently, try to capitalize on this and bring in Wobbuffet on a predicted switch to trap the foe. Because Wobbuffet is specialized for its targets, using Encore on setup sweepers is recommended so that they either are locked into a boosting move or deal pitiful damage to your team. However, Encore should be used with caution against possible Spikes users, as the continuous layers being added can cause great consequences to a team's longevity, even with Defog users. As mentioned before, refrain from taking on Choice Band and Choice Specs users, in addition to sweepers that have already set up, as Wobbuffet has no recovery outside of Leftovers and cannot take powerful attacks repeatedly.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>The only reason to use Wobbuffet is to support sweepers by trapping and removing their counters. Luckily, there are several sweepers that benefit from Wobbuffet's ability to trap, remove, or create setup opportunities. This includes Dragon Dance Rayquaza, Geomancy Xerneas, and Swords Dance Blaziken, which all may find it difficult to gain boosts to sweep on their own. Sweepers such as Mewtwo and Darkrai are also good teammates, as their high base Speed leaves them prone to being revenge killed by Choice Scarf users, which Wobbuffet can dispatch. Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Scizor and Thundurus can allow Wobbuffet to enter the battlefield without harm and ease switch predictions for Wobbuffet to trap its specified target. Although Wobbuffet is much more suited for hyper offensive teams, clerics such as Xerneas, Sylveon, and Blissey can help Wobbuffet with status conditions and overall longevity to allow it to fulfill its role on balanced teams. A very powerful core Wobbuffet can form is with Blaziken and Hidden Power Fire Geomancy Xerneas, as Wobbuffet can create multiple setup opportunities for both by locking the opponent into a resisted move with Encore or removing their usual checks and counters such as Giratina or Klefki.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>This is the set that has been the consistent bane of Wobbuffet's opponents since the release of Shadow Tag. Encore is essential, as it forces the opponent to use the same move for three turns and hence provides valuable opportunities for a teammate to come in and set up. Counter and Mirror Coat allow Wobbuffet to OHKO nearly all physical and special attackers respectively. Because of Wobbuffet's massive HP and low defenses, an attack aimed at Wobbuffet will take away a lot of its HP despite not doing much percentage damage; this is one of the reasons why the CounterCoat strategy is so effective on Wobbuffet. Safeguard is a helpful move in the last slot to prevent Wobbuffet and its team from status moves.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>28 HP EVs give Wobbuffet a Leftovers bonus number.The defensive EVs are optimal with a Bold nature, as they allow Wobbuffet to survive both Choice Band Tyranitar's Crunch and Haxorus's Outrage after Stealth Rock while also balancing Wobbuffet's defensive stats. A Calm nature enables Wobbuffet to take a Life Orb Bug Buzz from Volcarona, but this is very situational. Leftovers is a necessary item as Wobbuffet has no recovery and is therefore reliant on passive healing to stay alive.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This Wobbuffet set takes full advantage of the amazing combination of CounterCoat and Encore. CounterCoat lets Wobbuffet trap and eliminate Choice-locked attackers and mono-physically or mono-specially attacking Pokemon, and Encore lets it take advantage of Substitute users and setup sweepers as well. In order to ensure that Wobbuffet does not receive any prior damage, Wobbuffet should not be directly switched in but rather should either come in after a teammate faints or--more preferably--via Volt Switch or U-turn.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Wobbuffet works best on bulky offensive teams and balanced teams rather than hyper offensive teams that prefer immediate power. Aside from team archetypes, though, the only support Wobbuffet appreciates itself is a Wish passer for more healing than Leftovers can provide. Options for this include Chansey, Blissey, Vaporeon, Sylveon, and Florges. Chansey and Blissey are especially good partners as they appreciate Wobbuffet's ability to eliminate the Fighting-types that trouble them. Wobbuffet's Encore can really benefit setup sweepers, so Mega Charizard X, Gyarados, Breloom, and Lucario all make good partners. As previously mentioned, Wobbuffet appreciates Pokemon that can provide free switches with Volt Switch and U-turn; Scizor and Rotom-W can fill this role well.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>The combination of Encore and Tickle is deadly particularly for more defensive Pokemon. Encore will lock an opposing Pokemon into a move, while Tickle will slowly lower its Defense, allowing a Pursuit-using teammate to easily dispose of it. Counter and Mirror Coat are there for offensive Pokemon, but they aren't the main focus of the set.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>A Timid nature combined with full Speed investment allows Wobbuffet to outspeed Chansey, Blissey, Ferrothorn, Reuniclus, and Conkeldurr as well as other Pokemon that might want to Speed creep specifically for Wobbuffet. The rest of the EVs maximize physical bulk while still giving Wobbuffet a Leftovers number. Again, Leftovers is absolutely essential to keep Wobbuffet healthy, especially in sand and hail.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>The strategy behind this set is simple: to weaken walls and other defensive Pokemon with Tickle and then eliminate them with a Pursuit trapper. After switching Wobbuffet in on a wall, first use Encore so that it can't recover and then lower its Defense with Tickle. After the foe has been significantly weakened, send in a Pursuit trapper such as Scizor, Weavile, or Tyranitar for the KO. Additionally, Wobbuffet still has Counter and Mirror Coat for eliminating more offensive Pokemon such as Choice Scarf users, but bear in mind that this set sacrifices some bulk for Speed, so it might not be able to effiectively eliminate powerful attackers.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>A Pursuit trapper is mandatory, and Tyranitar and Scizor are the ideal partners. Setup sweepers are good partners not only due to Encore but also because they really appreciate the removal of walls, which allows them to sweep much more easily. These include Mega Charizard X, Swords Dance Talonflame, and Belly Drum Azumarill.</p>\n"
