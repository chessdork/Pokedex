     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Moonblast is a strong STAB move that hits a lot of Pokemon, namely Virizion, Sharpedo, Druddigon, Shiftry, and Spiritomb for super effective damage. Giga Drain also receives STAB and is useful for regaining back HP lost from Life Orb recoil; it is also used to hit Alomomola, Rhyperior, and Gastrodon, among other Pokemon, for super effective damage. Hidden Power Fire is useful to 2HKO Doublade after Stealth Rock, while also 2HKOing Escavalier and OHKOing Durant. Encore is used to deter Pokemon from setting up or using non-attacking moves such as Defog, allowing another teammate to come in for free. Tailwind can be a good move to use late-game for a couple turns of doubled Speed, which can help gain the upper hand. Nature Power is an option as it is an 80 Base Power move that gains +1 priority thanks to Prankster and the move's mechanics, and can be useful to pick off weakened Pokemon such as Fletchinder or Sharpedo without taking any unnecessary damage. Shadow Ball is an option that can be used over Hidden Power Fire to guarantee a 2HKO on Doublade, while also hitting Psychic-types for super effective damage. However, Hidden Power Fire is preferred as it hits Pokemon that Whimsicott usually lures, such as Escavalier.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>An offensive set with Life Orb allows Whimsicott to function as a check to various threats on offensive teams. Such Pokemon include Druddigon, Sharpedo, Rhyperior, Alomomola, Shiftry, Spiritomb, Jolteon, and Virizion, among others. The EV spread is straightforward, as it aims to maximize Special Attack and Speed, with a Timid nature to make use of Whimsicott's excellent Speed stat. Prankster is used to gain priority on Encore and Tailwind.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Whimsicott should be used as an offensive utility Pokemon on offensive teams to check the aforementioned Pokemon throughout the match. It should be kept at decently high HP to allow it to consistently switch into these threats, either through the use of Giga Drain or by keeping it safe from any unnecessary damage. If the opponent has Doublade or Escavalier, hitting them with the appropriate coverage move on the predicted switch to 2HKO is a risk that is worth taking. Use Encore on Pokemon that try to set up, or on a non-attacking move to allow a teammate to come in for free. If Tailwind is chosen, it should be used as a last resort move before Whimsicott goes down, for a couple turns of doubled Speed that its teammates can benefit from.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Stealth Rock is important as it can turn some 2HKOs into OHKOs, and also because Whimsicott can force some switches. Rhyperior, Cobalion, and Druddigon are good at setting up Stealth Rock, and the former two are also good at checking Poison-types such as Golbat and Drapion. Other entry hazards are also appreciated, and some setters include Qwilfish, which has access to both Spikes and Toxic Spikes, Accelgor, which has access to Spikes, and Omastar, which can set up Spikes as well as Stealth Rock. Spiritomb is a good offensive partner, as it can Pursuit trap some Pokemon that can prove to be annoying to Whimsicott, such as Delphox and Bronzong, and neutralize Pokemon like Doublade with Foul Play or Will-O-Wisp. Assault Vest Slowking is an excellent counter to the Fire-types that plague Whimsicott, whereas Assault Vest Druddigon is a good offensive check to Pokemon such as Moltres and Delphox. Likewise, counters to Poison-types are important; Reuniclus, Choice Specs Meloetta, and Delphox are powerful Psychic-types that can get rid of those. Finally, wallbreakers such as Moltres, Clawitzer, and Exploud are good teammates to punch holes in the opposing team, enabling Whimsicott to perform its role more effectively.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Encore cripples many Pokemon that try to setup, and this can force multiple switches. Stun Spore allows Whimsicott to support its teammates by paralyzing problematic sweepers, and it has +1 priority thanks to Prankster. The third move is a toss up and depends on what your team needs, as all of these moves are great. U-turn provides great momentum for the team, and it is very useful in conjunction with Encore as well as for scouting out moves. However, Memento lets Whimsicott sacrifice itself to lower its opponent's offensive stats harshly, and is great on offensive teams. Pokemon which appreciate this kind of support include Swords Dance Lucario, Nasty Plot Azelf, and Infernape. Substitute can also be used to block status and ease prediction. The last move is also a toss up. Taunt provides great utility and shuts down most defensive Pokemon and prevents Whimsicott from being Taunted itself. It also prevents sweepers from setting up. Moonblast can be used too and is a decent STAB attack which hits many Pokemon for at least neutral damage. Leech Seed is great at forcing switches and keeps Whimsicott and its teammates healthy.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Leftovers allows for consistent recovery as Whimsicott often comes in multiple times and gives it quite a bit of staying power when combined with Leech Seed. The given EV spread maximizes Whimsicott's ability to take physical hits and minimizes Stealth Rock damage as Whimsicott will be switching often. An Impish nature should be used if Whimsicott is not running Moonblast. However, a Bold nature should be used instead if Whimsicott is running Moonblast.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Use Stun Spore and Encore often to support your team and cripple Pokemon, and set up on defensive Pokemon such as Forretress. Use U-turn often as well to scout out moves and, due to the amount of switches Whimsicott can cause, gain valuable momentum. Do not stay in on powerful super effective attacks, as Whimsicott's bulk is subpar and it will most likely be felled by them.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Steel-types such as Empoleon and Jirachi make excellent partners because they have excellent type synergy with Whimsicott, as they can take the incoming Poison-, Ice-, and Steel-type moves for it. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Forretress is recommended as Whimsicott often forces switches, and residual damage can stack up quickly for the opponent. Cleric support from Florges or Umbreon is really appreciated as Whimsicott will be worn down fast and has no way to cure status it may have been inflicted with. Fire-types such as Darmanitan and Chandelure make good partners because they can take care of the Fire- and Grass-type Pokemon that like to switch into Whimsicott. In addition, Ground-types such as Dugtrio also make good partners because they can eliminate the Steel-, Fire-, and Poison-types for Whimsicott.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Prankster Encore allows Whimsicott to discourage setup sweepers and other defensive Pokemon from doing anything without getting an Encore. Combined with U-turn, Encore can give a lot of momentum, as Encore forces a lot of switches. Stun Spore allows Whimsicott to function as a fail-safe option to sweepers that threaten your team, allowing it to paralyze them before they're able to do anything thanks to Prankster giving it priority. Moonblast is used to allow Whimsicott to beat Pokemon it's supposed to check such as Hitmonlee, Druddigon, and Virizion, and it's the strongest STAB Whimsicott gets, and has good overall coverage, though Giga Drain can be used instead to better check Pokemon such as Alomomola, Rhyperior, and Gastrodon. The choice between them depends on what the team needs the most, as Whimsicott can't really do anything to Druddigon or Virizion with Giga Drain.</p>\n<p>Memento can be used over Stun Spore to lower the target's offenses and give a teammate an opportunity to sweep. Tailwind can also be used, and along with U-turn, it can give your team a couple turns of doubled Speed, which can help you get the upper hand in the game, although it is exactly two turns, which usually is not long enough. Taunt stops setup completely and can be used over Encore. Finally, Leech Seed allows Whimsicott to have some sort of passive recovery, and can help teammates such as Registeel or Delphox gain a little bit of health.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The Speed EVs allow Whimsicott to outspeed Adamant Hitmonlee while having the best possible HP and Defense to be able to switch into Pokemon like Druddigon, Rhyperior, Gastrodon, Alomomola, and Hitmonlee without much trouble. Leftovers is Whimsicott's only method of recovery other than Leech Seed, and Prankster is the best ability Whimsicott can have as it gives all non-attacking moves +1 priority.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>As Whimsicott has the ability to check threatening Pokemon such as Hitmonlee, Druddigon, and Rhyperior, it can directly switch into them, but be careful as the latter two have moves that can hurt Whimsicott, Fire Punch and Gunk Shot in Druddigon's case, and Stone Edge in Rhyperior's case. It should be noted, however, that Stone Edge can only 2HKO Whimsicott. Whimsicott can be used throughout the match, but it can be used early-game to spread paralysis and gain momentum, or mid-game and late-game to discourage setup sweepers with Encore or Taunt, as well as Stun Spore.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Other Pokemon with U-turn and Volt Switch, such as Jolteon, Swellow, Moltres, and Braviary can form a VoltTurn core with Whimsicott. If Memento is used on the set, then Whimsicott can be paired with setup sweepers to help them set up. Those include Cobalion, Virizion, and Durant. Whimsicott's weakness to Steel-types is rather obvious, and for that reason, Fire-types such as Delphox, Moltres, and Emboar are recommended, and Fletchinder can spread burns and render Escavalier setup fodder. Furthermore, Whimsicott also covers the aforementioned Fire-types' weaknesses and reliably checks Pokemon such as Sharpedo, Druddigon, and Rhyperior for them.</p>\n<p>Because Whimsicott has no reliable recovery, clerics, especially Alomomola, can provide useful Wish support. Alomomola also has good synergy with Whimsicott, resisting Fire- and Steel-type moves. Specially defensive Meloetta also has good synergy with Whimsicott, as it can use Heal Bell to cure Whimsicott from status, and likes the support Whimsicott brings with Leech Seed.</p>\n"

This includes but is not limited to: Swords Dance Lucario, Nasty Plot Thundurus, Belly Drum Azumarill, Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X, Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar, Swords Dance Scizor, and Tail Glow Manaphy.</li>\n<li>Heatran has good defensive synergy with Whimsicott; they form a good core for a balanced team.</li>\n<li>Gothitelle can trap and likely KO Pokemon that have Whimsicott U-turns out of, especially if they are paralyzed, so Gothitelle can likely outspeed them.</li>\n</ul>\n"
