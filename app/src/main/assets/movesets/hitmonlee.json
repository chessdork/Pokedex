     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>High Jump Kick still hits ridiculously hard without Life Orb, and is the strongest STAB Hitmonlee has access to. Knock Off is a good spammable move that's an annoyance to most Pokemon that switch into Hitmonlee; Knock Off also allows Hitmonlee to have a way to hit Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon, as well as to revenge kill some threats such as Delphox. Stone Edge is useful for picking off non-Speed Boost as Moltres, as well as hitting Golbat. In the last slot, Close Combat can be used as a reliable STAB move without High Jump Kick's chance of missing, which makes cleaning up easier. Rapid Spin can be used if no other Pokemon on the team can clear hazards, but it's generally inferior because Hitmonlee can't switch moves and therefore has a hard time getting past spinblockers if you predict poorly, and being locked into Rapid Spin isn't a good thing as it can be easily exploited.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Choice Scarf is used to boost Hitmonlee's somewhat lacking Speed, turning it into a very strong revenge killer that can outpace Jolteon, the fastest relevant threat, with an Adamant nature. The choice between Adamant and Jolly comes down to personal preference to whether more power or Speed is desired. With Jolly, Hitmonlee can outspeed positive nature base 80 Speed Choice Scarf users such as Braviary, but Adamant gives Hitmonlee more power.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This particular set is better used late-game to clean up once the opponent's team has been weakened. That doesn't mean it can't come in early- or mid-game to revenge kill opponents, however, as it can definitely do that. Spamming High Jump Kick isn't preferred, as the opponent might carry Protect or switch out to a Ghost-type Pokemon, so make sure there are no Protect users or Ghost-types to ruin Hitmonlee's day. Knock Off is a good move to spam and cripple incoming checks and counters, and so is Close Combat if you choose that in the final slot. Don't use Rapid Spin recklessly, only do so against targets Hitmonlee force out, and don't do it when a Ghost-type still lives in the opponent's team.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Hazards are almost mandatory for Hitmonlee. Accelgor, Qwilfish, and Omastar can set up Spikes and, in the latter's case, Stealth Rock as well. Rhyperior, Cobalion, and Druddigon are all good Stealth Rock setters, and Druddigon can even lure and KO Aromatisse with Gunk Shot. Strong Psychic-types such as Choice Specs Meloetta, Delphox, and Reuniclus can easily take out Poison-types, and are good wallbreakers to pair with Hitmonlee in general. Wallbreakers and sweepers that Hitmonlee can clean up after are also good; Life Orb Druddigon, Swords Dance Cobalion, Swords Dance Virizion, Choice Band Gallade, and Choice Band Sawk are all good at this, especially the Fighting-type Pokemon as they share the same checks and counters with Hitmonlee and can weaken them for it to sweep, and vice versa. Additionally, Pokemon that can take care of Alomomola are good, as Hitmonlee doesn't have the power to muscle through it. Rotom-C, Jolteon, Heliolisk, and Magneton can all do a good job at disposing of Alomomola. Finally, Moltres is a strong special attacker that can dispose of the physical walls that can switch in on Hitmonlee, such as Gligar and Amoonguss.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>High Jump Kick is a hard-hitting STAB move thanks to Life Orb and Reckless, although it's somewhat risky to use due to its miss chance and the massive recoil if it fails to land. Knock Off hits Ghost- and Psychic-types that don't care about High Jump Kick, and can cripple Pokemon reliant on their item. Rapid Spin lets Hitmonlee clear entry hazards, which is one of the things that sets it apart from the likes of Mienshao and Machamp. Mach Punch lets Hitmonlee pick off weakened threats. Sucker Punch can be used to smack Jirachi, which can be a large problem otherwise.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Reckless is the preferred ability, as it boosts High Jump Kick's power. Life Orb is used to increase Hitmonlee's damage output, and it turns High Jump Kick into an extremely threatening STAB move. The EVs maximize Hitmonlee's Speed and damage output. An Adamant nature is preferred, as with it Hitmonlee still outspeeds Modest Chandelure and 2HKOs physically defensive Hippowdon, whereas Jolly Hitmonlee only has a 32% chance to do this. Jolly lets Hitmonlee outspeed more Pokemon, however.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Hitmonlee can switch into very few physical attacks, due to its terrible bulk. When using Hitmonlee, you should know when to use High Jump Kick; it shouldn't be spammed when there are Pokemon on the other side that are Ghost-types or carry Protect.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Pokemon that appreciate having Stealth Rock cleared, such as Mega Houndoom, Mega Aerodactyl, and Darmanitan, are good partners for Hitmonlee; Darmanitan is able to put a huge dent in the Fairy-types that make Hitmonlee miserable in return. Pokemon that can't get through Steel-types, such as Crobat and Cloyster, are also good partners for Hitmonlee, as they have a much easier time doing their job without Steel-types on the field. Pokemon such as Shaymin and Roserade that can check physical walls are also good partners for Hitmonlee.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>High Jump Kick is the kicker in this set because it's a very strong move that is further boosted by Reckless, meaning that it will hurt anything that doesn't resist it very hard, OHKOing Pokemon such as Druddigon and Escavalier. Knock Off, in tandem with High Jump Kick, gives great coverage against Psychic- and Ghost-type Pokemon such as Reuniclus and Doublade. It also cripples a number of Pokemon such as Gligar, Doublade, and Golbat, removing their precious Eviolite. Mach Punch is a useful priority move that can revenge kill faster Pokemon that otherwise would threaten offensive teams, such as Sharpedo and weakened Cobalion. On the other hand, Sucker Punch is a stronger priority move that can take down Delphox and hit a few other targets that Hitmonlee otherwise can't touch, such as Fletchinder. Sucker Punch can be easily exploited, however, and Hitmonlee will miss out on revenge killing Sharpedo. In the 4th slot, the choice depends on the rest of the team. Rapid Spin can be used if the team lacks a way to get rid of entry hazards, but Poison Jab is Hitmonlee's only way of getting past Fairy-types such as Aromatisse and Whimsicott, 2HKOing the former and OHKOing the latter. Finally, Stone Edge is a move that can be used to hit Hitmonlee's checks and counters such as offensive Moltres on the switch, and KOing Golbat after Knock Off and OHKOing defensive Moltres.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>A spread of 252 Attack and Speed is used here to maximize both Attack and Speed, with the 4 leftover EVs dumped into Defense. The choice of nature comes down to preference. Adamant gives a little kick to Hitmonlee's attacks, allowing it to OHKO Pokemon it otherwise couldn't, but Jolly lets it outspeed positive nature base 80 Speed Pokemon such as Gallade, Kabutops, and Braviary, and also outspeeding Timid Rotom-C and opposing Hitmonlee. Life Orb is used to maximize Hitmonlee's damage output.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Use Rapid Spin whenever it is needed. If the opponent has a Ghost-type, then some prediction with Knock Off is required. Knock Off itself is a spammable move, so don't hesitate to spam it early on as it has no drawbacks. Additionally, a lot of Hitmonlee's checks and counters, such as Gligar, Golbat, and Aromatisse, don't like having their item removed. Use Mach Punch to revenge weakened targets such as Sharpedo lacking priority and Cobalion. Don't use High Jump Kick too much, as some Pokemon might carry Protect and the recoil would backfire. Before using it, make sure that the opponent lacks Protect or a Ghost-type Pokemon. Finally, use High Jump Kick to break down walls.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Hitmonlee appreciates entry hazards to help it break down walls. For that reason, Qwilfish, Accelgor, and Omastar are good partners to set up Spikes and, in the latter's case, Stealth Rock. Rhyperior and Druddigon are good setters of Stealth Rock, and Druddigon can lure and KO Aromatisse, a counter to Hitmonlee, with Gunk Shot. Doublade is a good answer for Aromatisse and can check Amoonguss. Grass-types that can counter Alomomola are also appreciated; examples of those include Rotom-C and Tangrowth. Steel-types such as Escavalier and, to an extent, Durant can deal with Fairy-types. Offensive Trick Room Reuniclus can deal with Poison-types and clean up after Hitmonlee has weakened some walls. Assault Vest Slowking is a good offensive pivot to pair with Hitmonlee for its ability to switch into Moltres, Gligar, and Golbat, which are counters to Hitmonlee.</p>\n<p>In general, Hitmonlee is good to pair up with another Fighting-type Pokemon for its ability to weaken their common checks and counters such as Doublade and Aromatisse, with Knock Off and Poison Jab, respectively, then allow its partner to sweep. The same goes for the other Fighting-type, as it can weaken said counters for Hitmonlee to continue sweeping afterwards. For this reason, pairing it with Fighting-types such as Virizion, Cobalion, Gallade, and Sawk is a good option. And finally, VoltTurn cores can work well with Hitmonlee to bring it in safely. Moltres with U-turn can lure Slowking and allow Hitmonlee to KO it with Knock Off or cripple the incoming switch-in. Swellow and Braviary both lure Registeel and Rhyperior and then U-turn into Hitmonlee for High Jump Kick to KO them.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Endure ensures that Hitmonlee's Liechi Berry is activated as soon as possible, letting Hitmonlee get the Unburden boost. At 1 HP, Reversal becomes a 200 BP move, OHKOing virtually anything that doesn't resist it. Knock Off smacks Psychic- and Ghost-types that resist Reversal, such as Chandelure, for super effective damage. Mach Punch is used to punish Pokemon such as Infernape that try to revenge kill Hitmonlee with their own priority, although it usually will not OHKO many Pokemon unless they're weakened by a fair amount or it hits them for super effective damage.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Hitmonlee's EVs are used to maximize its Attack and Speed. Liechi Berry increases Hitmonlee's Attack, making it a very potent threat when combined with Endure and Unburden. An Adamant nature is used to give Hitmonlee as much power as possible. Due to Unburden, Hitmonlee doesn't need a Speed-boosting nature, as it will already have all the Speed it needs to function.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Hitmonlee should usually be attempting a sweep late-game, when most of its common switch-ins are off the field or are weakened enough to be KOed by Reversal. Hitmonlee should avoid residual damage at all costs, as it will render Endure useless, and thus its sweep short-lived. Hitmonlee should also avoid Pokemon with Extreme Speed, which outprioritizes Mach Punch.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Hitmonlee appreciates entry hazard support, which makes it easier for Hitmonlee to clean. Froslass is a great partner, as it prevents Toxic Spikes from being set up with Taunt, and it sets up its own hazards easily. Azelf is also a good partner as, like Froslass, it stops opposing setup with Taunt, and can cripple Pokemon dependent on their item early-game with Knock Off. Pokemon that can KO Fairy-types are a godsend for Hitmonlee, as it has a lot of trouble with the likes of Aromatisse and Granbull. Nidoking and Nidoqueen are very good partners, as they can force the aforementioned Fairies out, set up hazards on them, and absorb Toxic Spikes. Pokemon that can take on Sableye, such as Infernape, work well with Hitmonlee, as they can switch into Sableye's Will-O-Wisp and threaten it out. Pokemon that can beat common Flying-types, such as Crobat, are great partners for Hitmonlee. Mega Ampharos counters Crobat and lures in Blissey, which Hitmonlee loves. Mega Ampharos also sponges common priority attacks.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Endure is used to get Hitmonlee to 1 HP, maximizing Reversal's Base Power and activating Liechi Berry. Reversal is Hitmonlee's strongest STAB move which hits a lot of Pokemon very hard. Knock Off gives it good coverage along with Reversal to hit things it otherwise can't, such as Slowking, Cofagrigus, Banette, and Jellicent. Mach Punch gives Hitmonlee its own priority to outspeed opposing priority users such as Aqua Jet Sharpedo and hit him before he is able to hit you, after Unburden's activation. Close Combat is an option to use over Reversal for its guaranteed power instead of having to be at relatively low HP to use Reversal, but it's a lot weaker than a Reversal at 1 HP. Stone Edge can also be used to KO counters such as Moltres.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Adamant with 252 Attack EVs gives Hitmonlee maximum power, as with Unburden doubling Hitmonlee's Speed, it wouldn't need to use Jolly. Liechi Berry gives Hitmonlee a kick in power, boosting its Attack by +1, and works perfectly combined with Unburden and Endure, allowing it to sweep with +1 Atk and +2 Spe, which lets it outrun the entire tier.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This is a late-game sweeper, so play with it accordingly. This isn't a wallbreaker, so don't bring it in early-game; instead, save it for late-game, when Pokemon such as Moltres and potentially fast priority users are taken down. Occasionally, Abomasnow and Hippopotas' respective weather conditions can hinder Hitmonlee's sweep, picking it off with their weather's residual damage when it is at 1 HP, so make sure those are taken down before Hitmonlee is sent out. Likewise, make sure that Hitmonlee's checks and counters are weakened. Use Mach Punch when the opponent's Pokemon might carry priority and has low enough HP for it to KO.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Stealth Rock users and hazard setters in general are good to pair up with Hitmonlee. Omastar, Qwilfish, and Accelgor can all set up Spikes and, in Omastar's case, Stealth Rock as well. Druddigon and Rhyperior can reliably set up Stealth Rock, and Druddigon can also lure Aromatisse and KO it with Gunk Shot. Strong wallbreakers are appreciated to weaken walls for Hitmonlee to sweep afterwards. Life Orb Druddigon, Delphox, and Moltres are all good wallbreakers to pair up with Hitmonlee, especially because the former can lure Aromatisse and the latter two can KO Amoonguss.</p>\n<p>In general, Hitmonlee pairs well with Fighting-types such as Gallade, Virizion, and Cobalion as they lure in the same checks and counters. Additionally, Reuniclus and Psychic-types in general are good teammates for Hitmonlee for their ability to easily KO Poison-types. Fletchinder can clean up after Hitmonlee with Acrobatics.</p>\n"
