     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Aqua Jet is mandatory because without it, Azumarill can't revenge kill weakened Pokemon or outspeed faster Pokemon such as Mamoswine, Volcarona, and Landorus. Play Rough is a powerful STAB move that is great for wearing down Rotom-W, as well as dealing massive damage to Dragon-, Dark-, and Fighting-types. Knock Off is the preferred move in the third moveslot because Azumarill can screw around with its common switch-ins by removing their item. The major advantage that this set has over the Choice Band set is that Azumarill is no longer restricted to using one move at a time, giving it the freedom to alternate between moves, limiting its pool of reliable switch-ins. Waterfall gives Azumarill a much more powerful Water-type STAB move to hit bulkier Pokemon such as Hippowdon and Heatran.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>While Special Defense investment might seem like a good idea in order to take best advantage of its Assault Vest, Azumarill is not only meant to tank special attackers, but also physical attackers. Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Gyarados, and Dragonite are dealt with much better by opting for HP over Special Defense investment, so that is what is chosen. 12 EVs are moved from HP to Special Defense in order to reduce amount of damage Azumarill takes from entry hazard and weather damage. With an Assault Vest and the given HP investment, Azumarill can easily tank hits from the likes of Greninja and Keldeo.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Although most of its sets are designed to put immense offensive pressure on the opposing team, this set is meant to transform Azumarill into an amazing offensive tank. Azumarill's massive special bulk when equipped with an Assault Vest allows it to take on a plethora of special attackers, such as Greninja, Kingdra, Landorus, and Keldeo. Azumarill is even able to take on Pokemon it couldn't before, such as Thundurus, which does a maximum of 79% to Azumarill with a Life Orb Thunderbolt and its KOed with the combination of Play Rough and Aqua Jet.</p>\n<p>Assault Vest Azumarill best fits on teams in need of a reliable offensive pivot. Azumarill is able to easily switch in on common special attackers that threaten offensive teams, such as Greninja and Keldeo, and can deal massive damage to them in return without losing valuable momentum. Remember to play conservatively with Assault Vest Azumarill, because its lack of recovery and susceptibility to entry hazards can wear it down relatively fast. Only directly switch Azumarill into resisted or weak special attacks, because very powerful special attackers such as Landorus and Mega Charizard Y can still deal a significant amount of damage to it on the switch.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>As usual, this set struggles to break through bulky Grass-types. Mega Scizor is a great offensive partner because it is able to provide Azumarill with useful switching initiative with U-turn and it can set up on Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur and Ferrothorn. Mega Manectric is able to weaken physical attackers with Intimidate and bring in Azumarill safely with Volt Switch, which makes it immensely hard to break through physically and specially. On top of that, Manectric can lure Electric-type attacks before it Mega Evolves with its Lightningrod ability, OHKO Gyarados, and fry Grass-types such as Ferrothorn with Flamethrower or Overheat. Breloom can deal massive damage to bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W and Suicune. Entry hazards are a huge problem for Azumarill due to its lack of reliable recovery. Latias is once again the best Pokemon for removing them with Defog, and also has useful Electric- and Grass-type resistances.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>This set aims to turn Azumarill into one of the most terrifying and unstoppable sweepers in the metagame. For the cost of 50% of its HP, Belly Drum skyrockets Azumarill's Attack stat all the way to a jaw dropping 1744, allowing for it to OHKO the majority of the metagame with Aqua Jet alone. Aqua Jet is the most important attack, because it allows Azumarill to hit Pokemon that would normally be able to outspeed and revenge kill it, such as Landorus, Gengar, and Thundurus. Play Rough is essential to break through Pokemon that aren't KOed by Aqua Jet, such as Dragonite, Rotom-W, Latias, and Gyarados. Waterfall provides Azumarill with a backup Water STAB move to OHKO very bulky Steel-types such as Mega Scizor and Skarmory. On the other hand, Superpower is Azumarill's only chance at OHKOing Ferrothorn at full health, but with the added disadvantage of lowering Azumarill Attack and Defense stats, which makes Azumarill more vulnerable to priority moves.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The EV spread allows Azumarill to outpace minimum Speed base 70 Pokemon and below, while an Adamant nature gives it as much power as possible. A Jolly nature and max Speed gives it the jump on physically defensive Rotom-W before it can retaliate with a Will-O-Wisp, but most tend to run Speed investment. A Sitrus Berry is the preferred item because it gives Azumarill an extra bit of HP after using Belly Drum, which keeps it from being worn down too quickly by residual damage or faster priority users. Leftovers is also a fine option to give Azumarill some form of passive recovery before it sweeps, but it's not nearly as helpful as a Sitrus Berry once Azumarill sets up. Lum Berry gives Azumarill free setup opportunities against Pokemon that carry status-inducing moves such as Rotom-W, but it's too situational.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This set is meant to tear apart teams once its few checks and counters are gone, so it is important not to sweep before they are removed or else it can be cut short. It's best to set up on Dragon-types locked into a move, such as Choice Band Dragonite or Choice Scarf Kyurem-B. Azumarill is also quite bulky, so it can successfully set up on weaker Bug-, Dark-, Water-, Fighting-, and Fire-type attacks. Because Azumarill forces a lot of switches, it finds many opportunities to set up on predicted switches. It's very important to keep Azumarill as healthy as possible before it sets up, because once its HP reaches below 50%, it's no longer possible for it to use Belly Drum.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>As with most sweeping Pokemon, the best partners for this set are the ones that can eliminate Azumarill's checks and counters, allowing for it to sweep without worry. Thundurus can wear down bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W, and with Hidden Power Flying it's a great lure to Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss. Mega Scizor can set up on Mega Venusaur and most other Grass-types that threaten to cut Azumarill's sweep short. Scolipede can pass Speed boosts to Azumarill so it no longer has to rely so much on Aqua Jet, while Shuckle can use Sticky Web to slow down opposing grounded Pokemon. Users of Rapid Spin or Defog are very important because Azumarill needs to be as healthy as possible before it can sweep; Excadrill is a good spinner while Latios and Scizor can use Defog. Entry hazard support is also extremely important for breaking Focus Sashes, Sturdy, and securing a few OHKOs. Ferrothorn is probably the best partner for the job because it can easily shrug off all Electric-, Grass-, and Poison-type attacks, and use them to freely set up Stealth Rock. Drizzle support from Politoed is also an option to give Azumarill a much more lethal Aqua Jet. Landorus is also a great partner for its ability to fit nicely on pretty much any offensive team.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Because of Azumarill's awful Speed stat, Aqua Jet is an absolute necessity in order to get the jump on faster Pokemon that would normally outspeed it, such as Mamoswine, Excadrill, and Volcarona. Play Rough is an incredibly powerful STAB move that can 2HKO bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W and Quagsire, and provides very useful coverage against the likes of Greninja, Dragonite, and Keldeo. Knock Off can smack predicted switch-ins and dispose of their item. Superpower is specifically for dealing massive damage to Ferrothorn, as it resists both of Azumarill's STAB moves and could potentially set up entry hazards against it with ease. As for the last moveslot, Waterfall is the preferred option for a much more powerful Water-type STAB attack to hit bulkier threats such as Heatran, Hippowdon, and Mega Scizor, which can all take at least one Aqua Jet.</p>\n<p>Although Azumarill doesn't really have too many other viable attacking options, there are a few moves in particular that it can use to get around a few of its counters. Return or Double-Edge can be used to 2HKO Mega Venusaur, which resists every single one of Azumarill's coverage moves, but it's not entirely worth the loss in power from dropping Waterfall.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature give this set maximum power, while the Speed EVs are to outpace minimum Speed Skarmory, which Azumarill can 2HKO after Stealth Rock and a tiny bit of prior damage. The remaining EVs are allocated to HP in order to increase Azumarill's overall bulk; 4 EVs are shifted into Defense so that Azumarill takes less damage from entry hazards. If you prefer Azumarill to have more move flexibility, then Mystic Water is an option for being able to switch between moves and bluff a Choice Band, but Azumarill loses out on a lot of power and the ability to break through bulkier Pokemon, such as Rotom-W.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>The purpose of this set is to punch massive holes into the opponent's defenses so a teammate can come in and clean up. Thanks to Aqua Jet and Azumarill's high Attack stat, it can also pose as a decent revenge killer, capable of picking off weakened foes and frail sweepers. One must not forget that Azumarill is also quite bulky, so it's more than capable of taking weaker hits multiple times in a battle if it has to, but keep in mind that without reliable recovery, it can be worn down quite easily. Because of Azumarill's low Speed stat and Choice Band locking it into one move, it's best to use a hit-and-run strategy to get the best results with this set, or else you open up opportunities for the opponent to set up on one of its attacks.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>One of the best offensive teammates that can be paired with Azumarill is Nasty Plot Thundurus because with Hidden Power Flying or Psychic it can deal with some of its biggest counters, such as Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss, as well as frying Skarmory. Thundurus-I also benefits from the pressure Azumarill puts on Hippowdon, Chansey, Mamoswine, and Latias, which are some of its most common checks. Rotom-W also checks bulky Water-types and can provide Azumarill with tons of free switch-ins thanks to Volt Switch. Mega Scizor and Talonflame can both set up on Grass-type Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur that threaten Azumarill. Much like Thundurus, Heatran also appreciates the removal of special walls, and can also deal with problematic Pokemon such as Scizor. Even with the recent nerf to Drizzle, Politoed can power up Azumarill's Water-type attacks, allowing for it to be a much more potent wallbreaker. Because Azumarill will be switching in and out quite often, Defog or Rapid Spin support is very beneficial to remove those pesky entry hazards. Defog Latias is by far the best entry hazard remover due to its fantastic defensive synergy with Azumarill, resisting both Electric- and Grass-type moves while Azumarill can easily shrug off Ice-, Bug-, Dragon-, and Dark-type attacks.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>While it may not be Azumarill's main STAB attack of choice, Aqua Jet is arguably one of the most important moves on its Choice Band set. As a priority move, it remedies Azumarill's poor Speed stat and helps chip off HP from weakened opponents. Aqua Jet has decent power, letting Azumarill take down even mildly weakened opponents and making it a very reliable revenge killer. Play Rough and Waterfall are next on the list as Azumarill's main STAB attacks. Both hit with a lot of power, have good coverage, and have useful secondary effects. When Azumarill holds a Choice Band, few Pokemon can sponge multiple attacks from it unless they resist its chosen move. The last slot is only for coverage on specific threats, as Azumarill's STAB moves do more damage most of the time. Ice Punch hits Grass-types, most notably Amoonguss, which would otherwise wall this set. Superpower smacks Steel-types, namely Ferrothorn, and OHKOes Mega Kangaskhan. However, it's riskier to be locked into Superpower, so it should only be used in those specific situations.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Choice Band is used to grant an immediate boost to Azumarill's Attack stat, giving it explosive power and the ability to revenge kill a much wider range of opponents. Maximum Attack investment and an Adamant nature make Azumarill as powerful as possible, and the Speed EVs let it outspeed uninvested base 61s and below, beating key threats such as Tyranitar. The remaining EVs are put into HP for additional bulk.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>In contrast with the Belly Drum set, this set's purpose is to deal as much damage as possible as quickly as possible without the need to set up first. Azumarill's powerful Aqua Jet makes it a powerful revenge killer capable of taking down a lot of neutral targets with moderate health. Due to its destructive nature, it is possible to play a little more recklessly with this set and let it punch major holes in opposing teams. Be careful, however, as this set is a lot more vulnerable to offensive strategies than the Belly Drum set is. It simply needs to take advantage of opportunities presented to fire off powerful STAB attacks at its opponents. A hit-and-run playstyle can also be used to great effect. As with all Choice-locked Pokemon, partner support is key to cover for Azumarill's weaknesses once its job is done and to ward off potential counters.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>The Choice Band set relies heavily on partner support. Because Azumarill is susceptible to opposing type advantages after revealing its set, teammates that can tackle Grass-, Steel-, and Poison-types are highly recommended. Fire-types are great partners, and Heatran in particular supports Azumarill well with its powerful Heat Wave, blasting away Steel- and Grass-types that Azumarill lures in. Trick Room setters are also great partners for this set, as the field effect helps mitigate Azumarill's low Speed. Heatran again pairs particularly well with Azumarill in Trick Room, and together they make a very capable offensive core. Azumarill can aid Fire-types by warding off Ground-, Rock-, Dragon-, and Fire-types. Partners that can handle Electric-types are great as well. Ground-types such as Landorus-T help take down Electric- and Steel-types, and can use Intimidate to lower the opponents' Attack. This set doesn't require setup opportunities, but it does appreciate lures that buy it opportunities to hit hard. Dual screens setters are helpful as they increase Azumarill's bulk, making it easier to switch in and out. Helping Hand users can boost Azumarill's power and help it reach some key KOs and revenge kill a greater number of Pokemon. Jirachi provides Azumarill with lots of useful support, as it walls Grass- and Poison-type opponents and can offer Follow Me, dual screens, Helping Hand, Trick Room, and speed control support. Keep in mind that due to this set's lack of Protect, it is susceptible to its partner's spread moves.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Play Rough, a powerful 90 Base Power attack (135 Base Power after STAB), is the main attack for this set. When coming off of Azumarill's immense Attack, it easily makes short work of many unprepared teams, and its ability to lower the opponent's Attack stat can be very useful at times. Waterfall is the secondary Water-type STAB attack that has near-perfect coverage with Play Rough. It has better accuracy than Play Rough and almost as much power, and is generally a more reliable move. Belly Drum can be used in this slot instead, giving Azumarill a high risk, high reward setup move that will quickly enable it to deal even more damage than before. With adequate team support, Azumarill can use this move to boost its Attack to insane levels and easily OHKO many opponents. Aqua Jet rounds off Azumarill's offensive arsenal by quickly taking down weakened foes, making up for its middling Speed stat and helping it function as a great revenge killer. Protect is the last move, and allows Azumarill to protect itself from an opposing attack and buy time for its partner to execute attacks. It also guards Azumarill against its partner's spread moves and stalls out opposing field effects.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Maximum Attack investment is used to make Azumarill as powerful as possible, while enough Speed investment to outpace 0 Spe Tyranitar and below gives it the ability to tackle most bulkier tanks without sacrificing too much bulk or power. The rest of the EVs are stashed into HP for rounded bulk. Sitrus Berry is used to give Azumarill a bit more longevity, healing 25% of its HP once it's whittled down to below 50%, helping it recover from Belly Drum. Azumarill's natural bulk allows it to survive most neutral attacks, and the Sitrus Berry can often turn 2HKOs into 3HKOs by boosting Azumarill's total usable HP. Lum Berry can also be used to help Azumarill heal off status conditions if necessary. A spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 Def is preferred for the Belly Drum route, which would appreciate the extra bulk to successfully pull off this costly set up.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Due to its below-average Speed, Azumarill really requires partner support in order to shine. It needs a good partner to buy it time and bulk while it dishes out powerful attacks and sets up, though its natural bulk can allow it to sponge a few neutral hits. In general, it should be brought in against Dragon- and Fighting-types that it can defeat relatively easily or to revenge kill weakened opponents. Due to its typing advantage, it's a good idea to use Azumarill to bait common Intimidate users such as Hitmontop, Landorus-T, and Scrafty and KO them with super effective STAB moves. It's generally best to play Azumarill as a hit-and-run attacker (unless it's running Belly Drum) due to its low Speed and high attack power. It isn't really as much of a flat-out sweeper as it is a revenge killer and pivot.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Hitmontop is a great partner for Azumarill, as Fake Out and Intimidate buy it a lot of time and bulk, increasing its longevity. Hitmontop also has Wide Guard, which is useful in stopping opposing Discharge users. Other Intimidate users such as Scrafty and Landorus-T are great partners as well. Partners that can target Electric-, Poison-, and Grass-types are really useful to help cover Azumarill's weaknesses. Ground-types are notable partners as Earthquake can target multiple threats at once while Azumarill uses Protect. Azumarill loves the company of status users: it greatly appreciates paralysis support as well as the free turns it can get from a partner's Spore. Rage Powder/Follow Me users are vital for Azumarill's success should it use Belly Drum, as they can redirect attacks and give it the valuable window it needs to set up safely. Amoonguss is a notable user as it walls Electric-types and can spread status, but unfortunately, it can't do much against Grass-types. This set could also work well with Trick Room, as Azumarill's low Speed makes it very fast while the field effect is active. If run with Trick Room support, Azumarill should use a Brave nature with minimum Speed investment. Dual screens users are helpful as they increase Azumarill's bulk, allowing it an easier setting up. Helping Hand users can boost Azumarill's power, helping it reach some key KOs and revenge kill a greater number of Pokemon. Jirachi is an awesome partner because it can provide Azumarill with Follow Me, Trick Room, Helping Hand, Speed control, and dual screens support, while also walling Grass- and Poison-types. Azumarill in turn can handle Fire-, Dark-, and Ground-types that threaten Jirachi.</p>\n"
