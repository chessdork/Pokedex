     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Both Draco Meteor and Dragon Pulse are run, with Draco Meteor being run for picking up OHKOes against opposing Dragon-types and frailer attackers. Dragon Pulse is a more reliable STAB option that doesn't miss or result in Salamence's Special Attack being halved. The next move is Fire Blast to hit Steel-types, which would otherwise be able to take its Salamence's Dragon-type STAB attacks. It is also used to hit Grass-types like Amoonguss, which can take Draco Meteor, for super effective damage. The final moveslot is reserved for coverage moves, the choice of which depends on what your team needs. Rock Slide has a percentage chance to OHKO both Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame. Stone Edge can be run over Rock Slide to guarantee the OHKO on Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame and generally hits a lot harder than Rock Slide. Because of how common Rock Slide is, Mega Charizard Y and Talonflame are often paired with a Wide Guard user to block Rock Slides. Stone Edge has the advantage of hitting through Wide Guards as it isn't a spread move. However, it comes at the cost of accuracy and the loss of the flinch chance. Hydro Pump can be used with a Timid nature, as it also guarantees an OHKO against Talonflame, and hits other Fire-types harder coming off the more invested Special Attack.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>A Speed-boosting nature is run to outspeed and Speed tie with other Choice Scarf Salamence running Modest or a Speed-boosting nature respectively. The EVs on this spread are simple; their purpose to both maximize Speed and Special Attack so that Salamence hits as hard and as fast as possible. A Modest nature could be run for a slight Special Attack buff if your team doesn't fear opposing Choice Scarf Pokemon.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Salamence is commonly played as a lead thanks to its high Speed, coverage, and Intimidate. Getting off an early-game Intimidate weakens your opponent's physical attackers before they have a chance to attack. The move that should be most used on this set is Draco Meteor, as it hits significantly harder than any other move Salamence has access to. Although there is a Special Attack drop, switching out isn't hugely detrimental as it gives Salamence another chance to activate Intimidate. The only times you will find yourself using Dragon Pulse are against weakened opposing Pokemon or when you can't switch to reset Salamence's Special Attack.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Mega Kangaskhan provides Fake Out support, which is always appreciated. On top of that, it can take on many of Salamence's checks and counters such as Gardevoir and Tyranitar by simply overpowering them with its ability, Parental Bond. Although Salamence and it share many of the same weaknesses, Garchomp has great offensive synergy alongside Salamence, partlydue to Garchomp's ability to fire off Earthquake freely thanks to Salamence's Flying typing. Rotom-W and Rotom-H both provide Will-O-Wisp support, also dealing with Steel-types that can take a Fire Blast in the case of Rotom-H. However, Rotom-W has the advantage of not sharing Salamence's weakness to Rock. Steel-types like Mega Mawile and Aegislash both have good defensive and offensive synergy alongside Salamence. This is because they can take any super effective hits that threaten Salamence and also dish out a sizable amounts of damage to many of Salamence's checks and counters, Gardevoir and Tyranitar for instance.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Draco Meteor is an immensely powerful STAB attack. Fire Blast is used in order to destroy Steel-types that resist Draco Meteor. Hydro Pump deals with Landorus-T, as well as several dangerous Fire-types, such as Heatran, which resist Draco Meteor and Fire Blast. Despite being a physical move in a special set, Stone Edge merits use because it hits for 4x damage against some extremely common Pokemon, specifically Mega Charizard Y, Talonflame, and Volcarona. Although Rock Slide may seem like a better move to have, the damage it deals it minuscule and isn't worth the moveslot.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Use Maximum Speed and Special Attack EVs to pose the biggest threat to opposing Pokemon. A Choice Scarf increases Salamence's Speed dramatically, allowing it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame. Modest increases Special Attack at the expense of Attack, though Timid can be used to outspeed Choice Scarf Genesect and +2 base 70 Speed Pokemon, like Ludicolo in the rain or Bisharp with Tailwind, but the power drop is noticeable. Attack EVs or an Attack-positive nature are not necessary, as Stone Edge should OHKO Mega Charizard Y, Talonflame, and Volcarona, with no investment. Intimidate lowers the Attack of both opposing Pokemon, which can improve the longevity of Salamence and its team.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>If all attacks hit neutrally, Draco Meteor will hit for the most damage, so that is the preferred means of attack. However, the Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor will start to become apparent with increased usage, so be prepared to switch Salamence out. Because of this, Salamence's gameplay will be hit-and-run, coming in, Intimidating the enemies, firing off a Draco Meteor, then switching out to undo the Special Attack drop. It switches in and out with relative ease, due to its defensive typing and Intimidate. Be careful what move you lock Salamence into, as often times the wrong move could mean the game. Stone Edge is solely intended for 4x damage against Mega Charizard Y, Talonflame, and Volcarona, and won't deal much damage otherwise. Do not Intimidate Bisharp, Tornadus, or any other Defiant or Competitive Pokemon, because they will get a boost and deal tons of damage. Rage Power, Quick Guard, or Follow Me can help Salamence to avoid a Defiant-boosted Sucker Punch, and Salamence's Fire Blast can OHKO Bisharp.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>While Choice Scarf Salamence is fast, there are still faster Pokemon, so Pokemon that can check or counter these Pokemon are useful. For example, Heatran can take out Timid Choice Scarf Genesect. Cresselia and Jirachi are great as Helping Hand users, increasing Salamence's damage output. Steel-type Pokemon, like Heatran, Jirachi, and Aegislash, deal with Ice- and Fairy-types with their super effective attacks. They are also immensely useful for switch-ins, as they resist the Ice-, Fairy-, and Dragon-type attacks that scare Salamence. Jirachi can use Follow Me to redirect super effective attacks aimed at Salamence. Aegislash provides Wide Guard support, which is excellent at deterring Rock Slide, Icy Wind, and Pixilate Hyper Voice, and it can effectively take out the Pokemon that carry these moves. Bisharp deters Icy Wind through Defiant.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Dragon Claw is a reliable STAB move, while Outrage is used late-game for more power. Earthquake provides much-needed coverage against Heatran and Tyranitar. Fire Blast is used to hit physically defensive Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Skarmory.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>A Choice Scarf boosts Salamence's Speed, giving it revenge killing capabilities. Moxie allows Salamence to boost its Attack every time it finishes off an opponent. 252 Attack EVs with a Naughty nature maximizes Attack. 252 Speed EVs maximizes Salamence's Speed, allowing it to outspeed the entire unboosted tier with a Choice Scarf. A Naive nature can be used to outspeed Adamant Mega Charizard X at +1, but the power loss is noticeable.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Salamence uses this set as a revenge killer and to pick off weakened opponents. Outrage is best used late-game when all of Salamence's checks and counters are weakened or gone, as the Attack boosts from Moxie, combined with Outrage, provide a massive damage output. That being said, using Outrage the first turn that Salamence is in is not advised.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Defog users and Rapid Spinners such as Mew and Excadrill are great partners, as they can get rid of Stealth Rock, as every time Salamence switches into it, it loses a quarter of its health, and Salamence does find itself switching out often. Entry hazard support from Ferrothorn and Skarmory is helpful, as it weakens opponents, making it easier for Salamence to OHKO them. Wallbreakers such as Mega Charizard Y make for good partners, as they can weaken enough Pokemon for Salamence to sweep effectively late-game. Choice Specs Magnezone is an especially good partner as it can weaken opponents and covers Salamence's weaknesses, while Salamence does the same in return for all of Magnezone's weaknesses. Dragon-types such as Garchomp are also good partners as they can also wallbreak effectively.</p>\n"

Fire Blast hits significantly harder than the above sets, and hits Steel-types for super effective damage which that would otherwise wall this set. Finally this set runs Hydro Pump to hit common Fire- and Rock-types for super effective damage and complement the rest of Salamence's coverage.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Unlike the previous sets this set uses a Modest nature to hit as hard as possible. However, a Timid nature can be run to maximize Speed if needed. Choice Specs hits far harder than either of the previous sets, which also guarantees more OHKOes than any other set. This power is such that a Modest Choice Specs Salamence's Draco Meteor is the most powerful Dragon-type move in the format.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>As stated, Draco Meteor is the hardest hitting Dragon-type move in the format, and because of this a lot of the time it is a good idea to just use Draco Meteor. As stated before, switching out to reset Salamence's Special Attack can be beneficial, as it also allows another Intimidate to further weaken physical attackers later in the game. If a Modest nature is run you must bear in mind that Salamence no longer outspeeds many Pokemon it did with Timid; however, the increase in power is very noticeable and you must play it to these strengths. As a lot of other Pokemon with a base Speed of 100 run an Attack- or Special Attack-boosting nature, Speed ties might not be lost. Do not bank on this, however. For instance Mega Kangaskhan and Mega Charizard Y both commonly run a neutral nature.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Tailwind is far more appreciated on this set than any other as it focuses more heavily on power than Speed. This extra Speed allows Salamence to take care of many of its old checks and counters. Fast Pokemon like Choice Scarf Gardevoir and Mamoswine can take on opposing Dragon-types that threaten Salamence. Steel-, Fire-, and Fighting-types are also all welcome partners for Salamence as they care of Steel- and Fairy-types.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Draco Meteor is Salamence's most powerful STAB move, and can pick up many KOs on common frail Pokemon or against opposing Dragon-types. While Draco Meteor is for power, Dragon Pulse is for consistency. It has the benefits of guaranteed accuracy and no effect on Salamence's Special Attack. Fire Blast is to hit the Steel-types that resist Salamence's STAB Dragon-type moves for super effective damage. As this set isn't running a Choice item and Salamence is a highly targeted pokemon, Protect is a strongly recommended move for not only scouting but also waiting a turn so your partner can take down the threat.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Haban Berry is run to allow Salamence to survive a Dragon-type hit. Draco Meteor is then fired off against the opposing Dragon-type for super effective damage, usually for an OHKO. However, for those who want extra power, Life Orb can be used, on top of which a Modest nature could also be run to further maximize Salamence's Special Attack. That said, it is advisable not to run a Modest nature when not carrying a Haban Berry as you are then losing Speed as well as the ability to survive a super effective hit. The EV spread is again to make Salamence's Special Attack and Speed as high as possible.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Because of the immense usefulness of Intimidate to weaken physical attackers, Salamence is often played as a lead. This is done to to somewhat check other common leads such as Mega Kangaskhan. Unlike any of the other sets, this set carries Protect. Protect is played to ease prediction and scout for an unexpected coverage move, like Ice Beam on Tyranitar. On top of that, it gives Salamence's partner a chance to KO the opposing threat. Dragon Pulse should be used when using Draco Meteor is not recommended, for instance when Salamence is one of the last Pokemon on field and needs to maintain its Special Attack for some later use. It is also used when the extra power of Draco Meteor isn't necessary and the loss of Special Attack would be a unneeded hindrance to your team.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>As Steel-types are problematic to Salamence even with Fire Blast, running Salamence alongside Fire- and Fighting-types to take on the Steel-types that can survive a Fire Blast is always a good idea. Other Intimidate Pokemon such as Mawile and Mega Manectric provide nice support and further weaken physical attackers; however,  be cautious of Pokemon like Bisharp that can utilize this to boost their Attack higher thanks to Defiant. Fairy-types, which are immune to Salamence's Dragon-type STAB moves, are weak to Steel-type moves. Steel also resists all of the types that Salamence is weak to. Steel-types thereby have both good defensive and offensive synergy alongside Salamence. Good partners are Mawile, Aegislash, and Ferrothorn.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Draco Meteor is a STAB heavy nuke, hitting many Pokemon hard. Fire Blast sears through the Steel-types that resist Draco Meteor, such as Aegislash and Scizor. Protect is a staple of Doubles because it gives Salamence a free turn of safety. During this turn, Salamence's partner can take out whatever is threatening Salamence. Hydro Pump hits Fire-, Ground-, and Rock-types much harder than Draco Meteor or Fire Blast, specifically Heatran, which resists Draco Meteor and is immune to Fire Blast because of Flash Fire. Tailwind doubles the Speed of Salamence and its allies for four turns, which can help slower Pokemon keep up with faster threats.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Maximum EVs should be invested into Special Attack and Speed to increase Salamence's damage potential. Life Orb increases Salamence's damage output significantly, but Yache Berry covers for Salamence's Ice-type weakness. Ice is common for an attacking type in Doubles, so Yache Berry can be a lifesaver. If Salamence is running Life Orb, it should only run 29 HP IVs in order to minimize recoil damage. If Salamence is running Yache Berry, though, it should run full HP IVs. Timid increases Speed while Modest increases Special Attack, both at the expense of Attack. The increased Speed that Timid provides should be used to keep up with base 100 Speed Pokemon, like Mega Charizard Y and Mega Kangaskhan. Intimidate lowers the Attack of both opposing Pokemon, which can inhibit a lot of would-be threats.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Protect helps Salamence avoid dangerous attacks like Fake Out, and Tailwind helps slower allied Pokemon take out faster enemies. Salamence should switch in, use Draco Meteor, nuking a Pokemon, then switch out to rid itself of the Special Attack drop. This also reapplies the Intimidate. Salamence's typing, along with Intimidate and Protect, help it switch in and out with relative ease. There are occasions, however, when Intimidate can be dangerous. Defiant Pokemon, such as Bisharp and Tornadus, get an Attack boost when Intimidated, making them more dangerous as threats.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Slower Pokemon that benefit from a Speed boost give Salamence purpose in carrying Tailwind. Some examples are Heatran, Excadrill, Mega Kangaskhan, Mega Heracross, and Sylveon; what you want are slower Pokemon with bulk and offensive capability that just need Speed to be a threat. These Pokemon are also helped out by Intimidate. Fake Out support from Kangaskhan and Hitmontop can give Salamence a free turn, which is useful to set up Tailwind or use a super effective attack. Hitmontop can also provide Wide Guard and Helping Hand support, but the second Intimidate can be dangerous considering the prominence of Bisharp. Helping Hand users, such as Cresselia and Jirachi, help increase Salamence's damage output. Pokemon that Salamence can switch to that absorb Ice-type attacks, like Rotom-W and Suicune, make good partners. Steel-type Pokemon, such as Jirachi, Heatran, and Aegislash, can take out Ice- and Fairy-type Pokemon with ease, as well as resist Ice-, Fairy-, and Dragon-type attacks. Jirachi can use Follow Me to redirect super effective attacks aimed at Salamence while resisting all of Salamence's weaknesses. Aegislash provides Wide Guard support, which is excellent at deterring Rock Slide, Icy Wind, and Pixilate Hyper Voice. Bisharp deters Icy Wind through Defiant while also benefiting immensely from Tailwind, due to its middling Speed. Scizor deals with Latios and Latias, as well as Terrakion, Choice Scarf Tyranitar, and Weavile.</p>\n"
