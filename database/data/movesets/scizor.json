     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Swords Dance allows Scizor to easily sweep teams, and thanks to this set's focus on bulk, it will have ample opportunities to set up. Roost allows Scizor to set up on anything that cannot 2HKO it, such as Garchomp without Fire Blast and Excadrill, and prevents Scizor from being worn down before it can sweep. Bullet Punch is Scizor's main attacking move, packing an effective 60 Base Power thanks to Technician and making up for Scizor's uninvested Speed. Knock Off allows Scizor to get a solid hit on many Pokemon that resist Bullet Punch, such as Rotom-W, and can also be of use to cripple common switch-ins such as Heatran. In the last slot, another coverage move such as Superpower or Bug Bite may be used. However, Superpower's defense drops can severely hinder Scizor's sweep, and Bug Bite, while immensely powerful, gets very poor coverage along with Bullet Punch.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The EVs might seem complicated, but their purpose is to allow Scizor to set up on specific threats. 248 HP EV investment makes Scizor as bulky as possible and reduces Stealth Rock damage. 176 Special Defense EVs avoid the 2HKO from max Special Attack Modest Mega Gardevoir's Focus Blast, which is important as Mega Scizor is supposed to serve as a good answer to it. An Impish nature and 0 Defense EVs is sufficient to avoid the 2HKO from max Attack Adamant Landorus-T's Earthquake and anything weaker. A fully physically defensive set is also an option to take advantage of Mega Scizor's enormous Defense stat. As an example, it avoids the 2HKO from Life Orb Terrakion, one of the strongest physical attackers in the OU tier, and eats up hits from the likes of such powerhouses as Life Orb Excadrill and Choice Band Azumarill. Scizorite is the main item, as Mega Scizor's bulk and extra power are too good to pass up, even for Leftovers recovery. Leftovers can be run if Scizor's traits and running another Mega are desired for a team, or even a Lum Berry to circumvent burn and bluff a Mega variant. Finally, Light Metal is the ability of choice because Scizor will be Mega Evolving immediately, taking advantage of Technician only after Mega Evolution. Prior to that, however, Light Metal allows Scizor to take slightly less damage when switching in to Grass Knot and Low Kick. Albeit situational, it is the only ability with tangible benefit to Scizor before it Mega Evolves. Technician should naturally be used if any item other than Scizorite is run, and can even be utilized in combination with another potential Mega to hold off on Mega Evolving and bluff a normal Scizor.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Although Scizor can certainly come out early- to mid-game against easy targets like Assault Vest Azumarill, Ferrothorn, and Mega Gardevoir, Scizor should not be attempting a boost until all of its various counters are either removed or weakened enough for it to KO at +2 with Bullet Punch or Knock Off. This holds true for defensive counters, such as Skarmory, as well, and in many cases, going straight for an unboosted Knock Off will be far more beneficial, as it makes these counters much easier to wear down. Due to the bulky EV investment, Scizor can set up against many prominent threats on both the physical and special side, including foes such as Garchomp, Mega Tyranitar, and Conkeldurr, often attaining two or sometimes even three boosts before sweeping.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Teammates that can easily wear down or take out foes such as Heatran, Rotom-W, Zapdos, Skarmory, and Mandibuzz are highly appreciated, as all of these Pokemon can prevent Scizor from sweeping. Kyurem-B stands out in particular, as it shares a decent degree of defensive synergy with Scizor and can easily take out every one of the aforementioned Pokemon. Heatran with Earth Power is also a nice partner, sponging any Fire-type attacks aimed in Scizor's direction, taking out opposing Heatran, and wearing Zapdos and Rotom-W down with Toxic. Excadrill also has a decent matchup against the aforementioned Pokemon, although it cannot switch in on any of them. A Stealth Rock and possibly Spikes user is also great, wearing down opponents and making it much easier for Scizor to sweep with Bullet Punch.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Bullet Punch allows Scizor to check Xerneas and revenge kill weakened threats. Superpower allows it to heavily damage Extreme Killer Arceus, as well as other Pokemon that are weak to Fighting-type attacks, such as Blissey, Mega Kangaskhan, and Rock Arceus. U-turn and Knock Off are for gaining momentum and disrupting switch-ins. Pursuit is an option for trapping opponents, primarily Mega Gengar, but Scizor doesn't enjoy being locked into it, and this version of Scizor is inferior to the Support set at performing this role.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Choice Band gives Scizor a lot of power. It is guaranteed to 2HKO most variants of Xerneas with Bullet Punch. The defensive EVs allow it to not be OHKOed by Jolly Life Orb +2 Extreme Killer Arceus's Earthquake after a switch into Stealth Rock from full health. A spread of 248 HP / 20 Atk / 48 Def / 192 SpD and a Careful nature can take Focus Blast, or even a Hidden Power Fire in the rain, from Xerneas after a Geomancy boost and 2 Stealth Rocks, whilst still hitting hard. 248 HP EVs reduce Stealth Rock damage.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Unless using the bulkier spread, this set struggles to switch in on opposing Xerneas and still requires some prior damage to defeat it; however, it can deal a minimum of 75% to Geomancy Xerneas with Bullet Punch. Superpower deals a minimum of 83% to bulky Extreme Killer Arceus. It tends to not switch in during many other parts of the game due to its relative frailty, especially since it requires the bulk it does have to defeat certain threats. Bullet Punch can also be used for revenge killing. Knock Off and U-turn allow Scizor to disrupt more defensive teams.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>The best Pokemon to pair with Scizor are those that can check Pokemon that obtain a free switch on it, such as Ho-Oh and Kyogre. Because of this, Pokemon such as Palkia and Zekrom pair well with it, as they are able to come in on some of these Pokemon and threaten them. Zekrom forms a VoltTurn core with Scizor, which is of great benefit to a team for the momentum it can provide.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Choice Band Scizor carries the strongest unboosted U-turn in the tier, allowing it to dish out massive damage while also providing momentum for its team. Similarly, with a Choice Band, Scizor's Bullet Punch becomes one of the strongest priority attacks available and makes it a great revenge killer capable of stopping the likes of Gengar and Belly Drum Azumarill. Knock Off provides a strong coverage move that can cripple many switch-ins, particularly Skarmory and Heatran, and easily put the opponent in a no-win situation. Pursuit, on the other hand, allows Scizor to trap Latias, Latios, and Gengar, putting a definite end to their use. Finally, Superpower allows Scizor to OHKO any incoming Heatran, as well as do massive damage to the likes of Conkeldurr and Rotom-W.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Maximum investment in HP and Attack ensures that Scizor is bulky enough to be used several times in a match while letting it hit as hard as possible. Specifically, 248 HP EVs are used to lessen damage from Stealth Rock. The remaining EVs are thrown into Special Defense, the lower of Scizor's two defensive stats. An Adamant nature ensures that Scizor hits as hard as possible. Choice Band is the only item considered, as it gives Scizor the highest power boost possible, and Scizor usually doesn't need to change moves.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Scizor finds many opportunities to enter the battle with its respectable mixed bulk and threatening attacks. Whenever one of its attacks is needed, Scizor can be send out to perform the appropriate duty, and its bulk often permits it to switch into attacks. A well-planned dual switch is often extremely rewarding, as few Pokemon outside of select group of defensive walls will want to switch into Scizor's U-turn or Knock Off. Although this set can be played fairly liberally, make sure to conserve Scizor's HP if necessary, as it has no means of recovery and can be worn down by entry hazards.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Users of Volt Switch and U-turn, such as Rotom-W and Landorus-T, can be used to form a highly effective VoltTurn core with Scizor. Rapid Spin or Defog support is highly recommended, as Scizor will be doing a lot of switching. A wallbreaker such as Kyurem-B can be helpful in breaking down the few Pokemon that can switch into Scizor safely, namely Skarmory, Hippowdon, and Mandibuzz. As always, Heatran is a great partner due to its easy absorption of Fire-type attacks, which Scizor will encounter frequently. If used as part of a VoltTurn core, a late-game cleaner such as Choice Band Talonflame or Mega Pinsir is often effective as a way to sweep the remnants of the opponent's team, as VoltTurn strategies often tend to spread damage very evenly throughout a team. Finally, entry hazards are a vital part of Choice Band Scizor's gameplay, as many of Scizor's checks, such as Charizard and Talonflame, are severely weakened by them, and this works well with Scizor's tendency to force switches.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Defog is the focal point of this set, as Scizor is an extremely bulky and reliable Defog user. Roost is mandatory, keeping Scizor healthy throughout the duration of the match, thus allowing it to Defog more than once. The third slot is dedicated to whichever move fits the team better: Bullet Punch allows Scizor to revenge kill weakened opponents and threaten Fairy-types, while Knock Off provides all-around utility and a deterrent to Pokemon that are dependent on their items, such as Heatran. Finally, U-turn allows Scizor to pivot out once it has used Defog, and this can be useful for grabbing momentum when Defog is not necessary. As this set does not invest in Speed, its great bulk and slow U-turn allow many frail Pokemon a free switch-in.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>By maxing out its HP and Defense, Scizor becomes bulkier than even Skarmory, easily taking hits from ferocious physical attackers such as Excadrill and Bisharp, with the remaining 4 EVs invested in Attack for a slight boost to its attacking moves. An Impish nature is chosen as it raises Scizor's Defense through the roof without lowering the power of its attacks. Scizorite is the primary item, as Scizor becomes significantly bulkier after Mega Evolving. However, should another Mega Evolution already be on the team, Leftovers can be used, although the loss in bulk is usually not worth it.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Scizor can be sent out against almost all physical attackers that lack a Fire-type move and gain a free turn to use Defog. Because this is set is not as commonly seen as the other ones listed above, bluffing an offensive set will also often gain it free turns, and switching into Pokemon like Sylveon and Chansey can also work. Although this set's primary role is to use Defog, its sheer defensive prowess allows it to work as a physical wall as well, acting as a full stop to several powerful physical attackers including non-Swords Dance Garchomp and Dragon Dance Tyranitar. Beware, however, that without super effective coverage, Scizor may not be able to rack up enough damage on some physical attackers to prevent them from boosting in front of Scizor, particularly Swords Dance Excadrill and Bulk Up Thundurus. Make sure your team has a way of handling these boosting threats other than Scizor, either through revenge killers or walls with phazing capabilities.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Although one usually thinks of Choice Band Scizor when considering members of a VoltTurn team, this Scizor set is actually also a great choice as it provides the Defog support that VoltTurn teams require. Note, however, that VoltTurn teams like to have their own entry hazards up as well, so Scizor should always be paired with a teammate, such as Landorus-T, that can be a reliable setter of Stealth Rock. Frailer attackers such as Gengar appreciate Scizor's slow U-turn to enter the battle safely; many of them, such as Talonflame and Mega Charizard Y, immensely appreciate the Defog support as well. As always, Heatran is a perfect teammate as it not only sponges up Fire-type attacks, but also has great stat synergy with defensive Scizor, as Heatran commonly runs a specially defensive set and will complement Scizor's great physical bulk.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Swords Dance allows Scizor to easily boost itself into a fearsome attacker, doubling its Attack stat in a single turn. Bullet Punch returns as Scizor's Steel-type STAB move of choice, easily dismantling the faster Pokemon that might attempt to check it. U-turn may seem like an odd choice on a boosting set, but thanks to Scizor's full investment in Speed and Attack, it allows Scizor to boost up even if some of its slower checks (such as Rotom-W) are still alive, hitting them with a boosted U-turn. On the other hand, Bug Bite is a stronger, more consistent attack that won't force Scizor to switch out, but its coverage isn't superb. Notably, however, Bug Bite can OHKO Rotom-W after Stealth Rock. Knock Off is Scizor's best coverage move, hitting many Pokemon for neutral or super effective damage alongside Bullet Punch, but Superpower can be used as it easily takes out Heatran and is Scizor's strongest attack against Skarmory, doing about 60% to it on average.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Full investment in Attack and Speed allows Scizor to outspeed many threats, including defensive variants of Heatran, Rotom-W, and Mega Venusaur, along with Jolly Mega Tyranitar, and hit them with powerful attacks to bring them down. An Adamant nature is chosen to give Scizor more power, as Bullet Punch is generally strong enough to take out the faster, frailer threats in the OU tier after they have been worn down. Scizorite is the item of choice, as the extra power, bulk, and Speed help Scizor in both sweeping and setting up. However, if a Mega Evolution slot is already used up, a Life Orb (with Technician) can be used instead, although the benefits of Scizorite will be missed. It should be noted that Life Orb Scizor (both Jolly and Adamant) has more damage output than Mega Scizor at the cost of bulk. Light Metal allows Scizor to take slightly less damage from Grass Knot and Low Kick before it Mega Evolves.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Because Roost is not on this set, it's important to preserve Scizor's health, particularly if Life Orb is being used. For that reason, it should be sent out mid- to late-game and kept for sweeping purposes, although it can come out earlier to gain momentum with U-turn or threaten a switch-in with Knock Off if it will take little damage in the process. Once a sweeping opportunity presents itself, Scizor should be sent out to start boosting. Ideally, Scizor should be setting up against Pokemon that cannot do much to it, such as Mega Venusaur or Sylveon. It's important that Scizor's counters, namely Pokemon such as Skarmory or Hidden Power Fire Greninja, are removed or weakened before it attempts a sweep. Without bulk investment or Roost, it's harder for Scizor to come back in later in the match and sweep again.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Terrakion is a good teammate for Scizor as they can break down one another's counters to start a sweep. Keldeo is a great partner, easily weakening Heatran, Skarmory, and Landorus-T, whereas Keldeo's common switch-ins such as Mega Venusaur and Sylveon tend to be complete setup bait for Scizor. Stealth Rock and Spikes support from the likes of Ferrothorn can be invaluable to getting a sweep going, easily wearing down the opponent's team. Rotom-W is a great partner due to its access to Volt Switch, easily forming a VoltTurn core with Scizor. In addition, a burnt enemy from Rotom-W's Will-O-Wisp is very easy for Scizor to set up on. Finally, because this Scizor has no way of recovering health and less bulk than other variants, a Defog or Rapid Spin partner such as Latias (which shares decent defensive synergy with Scizor) can aid greatly in setting up. Although less reliable, Wish and Healing Wish support from Pokemon like Sylveon and Latias, respectively, can be used to give Scizor a second chance at sweeping.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Roost gives Scizor a way to repeatedly check prominent threats such as Bisharp, Latias, Latios, most Fairy-types, and some Dragon-types that offensive sets cannot deal with. U-turn is a good STAB move that Scizor can use to switch into a more favorable match-up, especially against Skarmory; it also provides the team with offensive momentum. Bullet Punch gives Scizor a solid STAB move which is necessary to hit Fairy-and Dragon-types such as Clefable and Kyurem-B. Bullet Punch is also a priority attack that is boosted by Technician, which mitigates Scizor's horrible Speed. Knock Off is a great move to round off Scizor's coverage, neutering walls such as Landorus-T, Hippowdon, and Heatran on the switch while also hitting Pokemon such as Skarmory. Other options on this set include using Pursuit instead of Knock Off to trap Pokemon such as Latios, Latias, and Mega Gardevoir, which can assist Pokemon such as Keldeo in sweeping. It also puts Kyurem-B into the KO range of Bullet Punch. Adding to Scizor's coverage, Superpower hits common switch-ins to Scizor such as Heatran while being able to do a good amount of damage to Skarmory, forcing it to Roost. Superpower is also the only move in Scizor's arsenal that is guaranteed to OHKO Bisharp.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Scizor's EV spread focuses on HP, Special Defense, and Attack. 248 HP EVs make Scizor as bulky as possible and reduce Stealth Rock damage. 164 Special Defense EVs are used to help Scizor sponge up attacks from the likes of Latios and Latias, while 96 Attack EVs give Scizor additional damage output. Light Metal is the ability of choice as it reduces the damage of Low Kick and Grass Knot, and Mega Scizor gains Technician upon Mega Evolving anyway.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This Scizor set is a medium between the other sets, being more offensively-oriented than the Defog set but more defensively-oriented than the Swords Dance set. Mega Scizor can act as a lure to Pokemon that counter it such as Heatran and Skarmory, then use U-turn to escape the unfavorable match-up. U-turn should also be used to build or keep offensive momentum for the team. Scizor makes for a good switch-in to Fairy-type Pokemon, as it resists their STAB moves and can retaliate with a super effective Bullet Punch. However, watch out for Clefable as it sometimes carries a Fire-type move which often OHKOes Scizor. Another Pokemon to watch out for is Mega Gardevoir, as it occasionally carries Hidden Power Fire or Will-O-Wisp, which are moves that Scizor dislikes.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Notable teammates of Mega Scizor should be able to counter Keldeo, Thundurus, and Fire- types such as Heatran. Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Rotom-W, Keldeo, Terrakion, and Heatran all make for great partners, as they can beat the Fire-types that Mega Scizor hates. Pokemon that counter or check Thundurus such as Terrakion, Gastrodon, and Hippowdon also make for great teammates as they either wall it or threaten it out. Mega Scizor has no way to really damage Keldeo, and a Hydro Pump from it could be deadly, so teammates that can check Keldeo such as Latias and Latios make good teammates. As Mega Scizor is a counter to Fairy-types, Pokemon that are weak or are countered by Fairy-types are good teammates to Mega Scizor as well.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Bullet Punch does at least 54% to bulky Geomancy Xerneas. Roost provides consistent recovery. Superpower deals heavy damage to Extreme Killer Arceus and Chansey, while Pursuit gives Scizor the opportunity to handle Mega Gengar, though for this, Scizor should run the specially defensive spread mentioned in Set Details. U-turn and Toxic are both useful moves for hitting opposing switch-ins; Toxic is especially useful for handling Calm Mind Arceus formes. Knock Off removes foes' items. Defog, while not listed, is a fantastic support move that Mega Scizor can use, but it may struggle with pulling it off against more offensive teams. Scizor can rarely afford the moveslot to run Swords Dance, but it can help to Pursuit trap Aegislash and also clean up late-game.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Light Metal is used to reduce the power of the rare Low Kick or Grass Knot that Scizor switches into, since when it Mega Evolves, it regains Technician anyway. It is also useful when Ditto switches in before Scizor, as it is left without the boost of Technician. It is difficult to bluff a Choice Band set with Technician since there is such a drop in power, so Light Metal is generally the most useful. A spread of 248 HP / 16 Atk / 116 Def / 128 SpD with an Adamant nature can be used as an exchange of power for bulk without losing the ability to check Xerneas and Extreme Killer Arceus sufficiently. A spread of 248 HP / 16 Atk / 244 SpD with an Adamant nature is still capable of almost always 2HKOing standard Geomancy Xerneas, but because of the increased special bulk, it is the recommended spread for trapping Mega Gengar. It should also be noted that it can deal at least 54% to bulky Extreme Killer Arceus with Superpower. 248 HP EVs reduces the damage taken from Stealth Rock by Scizor.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Unless Scizor is using a specially defensive spread, it can still have difficulty switching directly into Xerneas, but can deal significant damage to it before being attacked. The main spread can deal a minimum of about 57% to standard Geomancy Xerneas. If possible, you should inflict prior damage upon Xerneas in order to bring it into the KO range of Scizor's Bullet Punch. Likewise, Extreme Killer Arceus should be brought into the KO range for Scizor's Superpower; the main spread can deal at least 63% to bulky Extreme Killer Arceus whilst doing at least 71% to offensive Extreme Killer Arceus. When using Scizor to trap Mega Gengar, it in general works best when double switched into it, and must be wary of Hidden Power Fire as well as Destiny Bond. Bullet Punch can also be used to revenge kill heavily weakened Pokemon. Scizor has few other opportunities to come in against offensively oriented teams, whilst against less offensive teams it should use any free turns to disrupt the foe.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Choice Scarf Zekrom pairs nicely with Scizor, as it can take care of Ho-Oh and Kyogre, whilst Mega Scizor checks both Extreme Killer Arceus and Xerneas, and they also can form a VoltTurn core. For a team relying on it to Pursuit trap Mega Gengar, options that require that form of support, such as defensive Xerneas, pair well with it. Other teammates that can handle Fire-types and other threats that get a free switch on Scizor, such as Kyogre, are ideal. You should also carry a second check to Geomancy Xerneas, such as Ho-Oh, if you are using Scizor to Pursuit trap Mega Gengar, in case you lose Scizor to Destiny Bond.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Scizor has fewer options this time around, but it's still great at what it does. Bullet Punch is the go-to attack for Scizor, as it has 90 Base Power after the boosts from STAB and Technician, making it an even stronger priority move than Extreme Speed. Due to its power, even Pokemon that resist Steel-type moves will take a good chunk of damage from it. As Bug Bite, Scizor's Bug-type STAB move of choice, is unavailable this season, Scizor must be content with using X-Scissor. Thanks to its typing, Scizor usually has no issue setting up with Swords Dance, which increases the power of its attacking moves greatly. The boost from Swords Dance can also be used to overcome any drops incurred from opposing Pokemon with Intimidate. For the last slot, Scizor has two good choices: Protect and Roost. Protect, a general VGC move, can be used to keep Scizor out of harm's way while a teammate deals with a certain threat. On the other hand, Roost heals Scizor and prolongs its time on the battlefield.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Scizor has two item options for this set. Considering that the sets for Mega Scizor and standard Scizor are currently identical, you can run Scizorite for the boosts that it provides. If you already have a Mega Evolution on your team, you can opt to run a Lum Berry instead, which can protect Scizor if a burn comes its way. Regular Scizor has good stats, so Mega Evolving it is not a necessity. If you decide to just stick with regular Scizor, it must run Technician as its ability. There is no reason to use either of the other abilities: Swarm is pointless as Bullet Punch is the main attack whereas Light Metal does not help Scizor in any notable way.</p>\n<p>252 HP EVs increase Scizor's bulk, allowing it to better tank attacks, while 252 Attack EVs along with and Adamant nature allow Scizor to deal as much damage as possible with its attacking moves. Running Jolly does not allow Scizor to outspeed anything noticeable, and is not worth the decrease in power.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Scizor should be used either as a lead or a late-game cleaner. If it is partnered with a Pokemon that can take care of its checks and counters, Scizor can make for a good lead, as it can possibly set up and wreak havoc early on. On the other hand, after the Pokemon that can stop it have been sufficiently weakened or KOed, Scizor can be a great late-game cleaner with its incredibly strong Bullet Punch. Regarding Mega Evolution, there is no reason to wait unless you are attempting to bluff having another Mega Pokemon. Scizor gets some nice boosts from its Mega Evolution and so should be Mega Evolved as soon as possible.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Mega Tyranitar and regular Tyranitar make great teammates for Scizor and Mega Scizor, respectively. The sandstorm Tyranitar summons does not harm Scizor, can help wear down opposing Pokemon, and can be used to win the weather war. Tyranitar can also take care of the Fire-types that threaten Scizor. Water-types pair well with Scizor as they have decent defensive synergy with it. Rotom-W and Scizor cover each other's weaknesses nicely; one can deal with what threatens the other. Politoed makes a good partner as the rain it brings halves the damage done to Scizor by Fire-type moves. Another great partner for Scizor is Chandelure, as it can take care of opposing Steel-types with its Fire-type STAB moves. Also, with Flash Fire, it can discourage the opponent from using Heat Wave, as the move will give Chandelure a free boost to its Fire-type moves. Salamence makes a good teammate for Scizor as well, as it can take care of Steel-type Pokemon with either Flamethrower or Fire Blast. Furthermore, it has Intimidate to help prolong Scizor's time on the field.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Swords Dance is awesome because it doubles Scizor's attack power and overrides the bane of all physical attackers, Intimidate. Bullet Punch is a powerful priority move, allowing Scizor to always get the first hit and hopefully KO his prospective attacker. Bug Bite is his strongest STAB attack after Technician, and can also steal Sitrus Berries from his targets, providing pseudo-recovery. Protect is a necessity for any offensively oriented Pokemon, buying a turn to maneuver to a better position whenever a Scizor counter comes out.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The EVs help Scizor outspeed 0 Speed Rotom-W so that he can Bug Bite (for a KO if at +2) before eating Will-O-Wisp. Scizor's Attack is maximized, as he is an offensive Pokemon, and the rest is put into HP. Scizorite greatly increases Scizor's bulk and slightly increases his power and Speed, so it's the best option by far. Non-Mega Scizor is pretty underwhelming, but if you really want to use Scizor and already have another Mega Pokemon, Lum Berry is the best item as it cures burns, sleep, and paralysis, all of which cripple him. Scizor can try to replace Protect with Superpower to hit Steel-types, but will have a really rough time without Protect.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>It's tempting to use Swords Dance whenever possible, but this is hardly necessary and forces Scizor to take a lot of chip damage. Simply attack and Protect unless Swords Dance is necessary (because an Intimidate user is switching in) or you suspect Scizor will get a free turn. Especially avoid using Swords Dance before the opponent's Fire-types are eliminated or it will almost always be a wasted turn. Some Pokemon can ignore Scizor's STAB attacks and are incredibly dangerous once they get rolling, including Heatran, Charizard, and Thundurus. If your opponent has one of these, keep Scizor light on his feet to avoid giving them free turns. If the opponent's team looks like it has Scizor trouble, it's probably packing Hidden Power Fire. Know the common users, such as Cresselia and Latios, and scout for it with Protect (or KO them). Try to avoid dry switching Scizor in to take hits, especially before he Mega Evolves. Even resisted hits can deal near 50% to normal Scizor, which makes sweeping much harder.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Pokemon that can destroy Fire-types, such as Garchomp, Tyranitar, and Politoed, are a necessity for Scizor. Not only can they scare them from switching in on Scizor, but they can reclaim momentum if the Fire-types do get a free turn. Follow Me users seem like a good option to redirect Will-O-Wisp and strong attacks at first, but most Follow Me users complement Scizor's offensive coverage poorly (and cannot redirect the main Fire-type STAB move in the metagame, Heat Wave). As such, Pokemon that directly defeat common Will-O-Wisp users, such as Shaymin-S, are typically better picks. Supporting Scizor is awkward because he wants Grass-types to handle Rotom-W yet also wants partners that smash Fire-types. Mold Breaker Excadrill can make a good partner, being able to KO both, but can switch in on neither. Scizor works very well on teams lacking in speed control; his Bullet Punch is the second strongest priority move in the game and his STAB options are super effective on most of the common Trick Room users. He can also work well on semi-Trick Room, as he functions well both in and outside the effect, though full Trick Room teams are typically better off with Escavalier. As Scizor is an efficient Fairy-killer, it makes a great member of teams that struggle with Hyper Voice spam, and a partner for Pokemon such as Hydreigon and Conkeldurr that despise Togekiss's Follow Me.</p>\n"
