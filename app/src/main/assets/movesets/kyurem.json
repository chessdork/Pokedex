     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Draco Meteor is the hardest hitting STAB move with a nasty secondary effect that often forces Kyurem out. Ice Beam, on the other hand, is a more spammable STAB move. Earth Power rounds out Kyurem's coverage, hitting Steel- and Fire-types that plague Kyurem. Outrage allows Kyurem to hit fast, frail threats on the physical side or break though special walls, such as Blissey or Goodra.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>A Hasty nature is used so that Kyurem can outspeed Jolly Choice Scarf base 95 Speed Pokemon. A Mild nature can be used to boost Special Attack if Choice Scarf Pokemon in that speed tier aren't a problem to the team. The EVs simply capitalize on Kyurem's Special Attack and Speed with the four leftover EVs put in Attack to boost Outrage's power.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This set gets the jump on some of Kyurem's checks, as most expect the SubRoost set. Choice Scarf allows Kyurem to outpace threats that tend to threaten Kyurem, such as Infernape, Mega Aerodactyl, and non-Choice Scarf Mienshao. This set also has no means of recovery, so it should be used late-game after the opponent is worn down by Kyurem's teammates to clean up or act as a revenge killer.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Although Choice Scarf Kyurem can surprise some of its checks, it doesn't have the power that Choice Specs or Life Orb has and thus needs a wallbreaker. Choice Band Victini does this well, resisting Fighting- and Steel-type moves aimed at Kyurem. Florges is still a great partner to this set, especially as Kyurem is more prone to paralysis and has no recovery, so Wish / Aromatherapy support alleviates that. Entry hazard support and removal is almost necessary with this set as it doesn't have the power to OHKO or 2HKO Pokemon by itself like Life Orb Kyurem does, and it is easily worn down by entry hazards. Forretress is an excellent partner as it sets up Spikes, Stealth Rock, and can spin away any entry hazards. Sticky Web isn't as needed on this set, but it helps Kyurem by allowing it to outspeed other Choice Scarf Pokemon below base 95 Speed.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Draco Meteor and Ice Beam are great STAB moves that hit hard thanks to Choice Specs. Earth Power puts the Fire- and Steel-types in their place. Dragon Pulse provides a more reliable Dragon-type STAB move, allowing Kyurem to stay in and not lose momentum. Flash Cannon hits Florges and Focus Blast allows Kyurem to power through the other special walls, such as Snorlax and Umbreon.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>These EVs are standard for a special sweeper, with max Special Attack, max Speed, and a Timid nature. This, combined with Choice Specs, makes Kyurem extremely lethal. However, a Modest nature can be used as most of Kyurem's checks are faster. It should be noted that with a Modest nature, Kyurem can 2HKO Florges after Stealth Rock damage with Flash Cannon. Sticky Web from the likes of Galvantula or Shuckle really helps this set to outspeed faster threats and kill them.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This set is meant to wallbreak and use Kyurem's nice offensive typing to its advantage. This set plays as more of a pivot thanks to its main STAB attack, Draco Meteor, lowering its Special Attack by two stages every time it is used. However, depending on its last move, it can also stay in and just spam a move until it is KOed.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Kyurem appreciates entry hazard removal as it is susceptible to all of them and this set plays like more of a pivot. Mega Blastoise is a decent partner as its natural bulk allows it to spin multiple times throughout the match, and it complements Kyurem's wallbreaking capabilities. This set appreciates setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Lucario and Mienshao as partners, due to Kyurem crippling walls, allowing for easier setup opportunities. This set still appreciates entry hazard support to secure OHKOs.</p>\n"

Outrage is to get around special walls such as Blissey, while Iron Head is specifically for Florges, a common switch-in to Kyurem. Roost, however, provides reliable recovery and helps mitigate Life Orb recoil.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The EVs are tailored for hitting as hard as possible on the special side while using Kyurem's base 130 Attack to its advantage. It should be noted that 104 Atk EVs can guaranteed the 2HKO on Umbreon with Outrage, but that is the only reason to invest more than 4 EVs into Attack as Outrage 2HKOs Blissey. A Hasty nature is used to increase damage so that Outrage or Iron Head can hit harder, but a Timid nature is preferred if Roost is selected for the fourth moveslot.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This set takes advantage of Kyurem's 130 / 130 attacking stats along with the power Life Orb provides help Kyurem to hit hard both physically and specially. The coverage Kyurem has is a godsend, as it weakens the team to let late-game cleaners to come in and finish off the opponent. It can also weaken walls so that setup sweepers can set up and power through the opponent.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Florges is still an excellent partner for this set, especially if Kyurem doesn't opt for Roost, as it appreciates the Wish / Aromatherapy support. This set really appreciates cleaners and setup sweepers as partners, such as Choice Scarf Krookodile or Swords Dance Lucario. This set also appreciates entry hazard support to secure OHKOs. Forretress is a great partner as most of Kyurem's checks are weakened by Spikes. Sticky Web also helps Kyurem outspeed faster threats. Galvantula or Shuckle can work, with the former providing offensive pressure and the latter able to consistently set Sticky Web up, should it be Defogged or spun away.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Even though SubRoost is the only viable option for Kyurem without it being outclassed, it fits the role almost perfectly, utilizing its great bulk, set of resistances, and its Pressure ability. Substitute allows Kyurem to avoid status, eases prediction between Earth Power and Ice Beam, and prevents Kyurem from being revenge killed easily, which makes up for its lackluster Speed. Thanks to Kyurem's above average-defenses and ability to make 101 HP Substitutes, there are many situations where Kyurem can set up a Substitute; whether it be against fixed-damage moves such as Seismic Toss, or resisted moves which fail to break its Substitute, such as Volt Switch and Hydro Pump. When Roost is added to the equation, Substitute can be used to stall out opposing Pokemon's PP with its ability Pressure. This is especially helpful against Pokemon who have only one move that can break its Substitute, such as Ferrothorn with Gyro Ball.</p>\n<p>Despite all of its flaws, Kyurem has a massive base 130 Special Attack and great neutral coverage, along with one of the strongest Ice Beams in the tier. Ice Beam is Kyurem's best STAB attack due to its great offensive coverage and is almost mandatory on any non-hail set, in which case Blizzard should be used. Earth Power allows Kyurem to muscle past Ice-type resists, specifically Fire- and Steel-types, keeping it from being walled by the likes of Heatran. Kyurem's ability to stall works in tandem with Earth Power, allowing it to take care of all Rotom-W and Rotom-H, the only two OU viable Pokemon that resist Ice Beam and Earth Power's coverage.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The EVs allow Kyurem to take minimum damage from Stealth Rock while giving it the ability to set up 101 HP Substitutes. Maximum Speed allows it to Speed tie with neutral natured Kyurem-B. The rest of the EVs are put into its Special Attack with a Modest nature to give it as much power as possible. Leftovers is the preferred item, as it makes Kyurem less reliant on Roost for recovery.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Kyurem should be sent out on a Pokemon that is unable to break its Substitute, such as Rotom-W, or a Pokemon which can be PP stalled until it can't break its Substitute, such as Ferrothorn, or a Pokemon that is threatened by its attacks, such as Gliscor. Once Kyurem has switched in, it should use Substitute immediately, as it limits the ways that the opponent can deal with it. However, if one of its hard counters is likely to switch in, such as Suicune or Sylveon, Substitute is generally a bad choice in that situation as it will be shaving off 25% of its health for no benefit. Use this as an opportunity to double switch to a Pokemon that can take advantage of its hard counters. If an attacker with low-PP moves such as Focus Blast or Stone Edge are likely to switch in, it may be a good idea to use Substitute as they switch in, then stall them until Kyurem needs to Roost. However, Kyurem should not sacrifice health to PP stall in a position where it cannot gain that health back through Roost.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Having either Rapid Spin or Defog is mandatory for Kyurem to succeed. Mandibuzz and Skarmory are your best options, as they have great synergy with Kyurem. Since Kyurem has trouble with special walls, strong physical attackers such as Pinsir and Garchomp are appreciated. Pokemon that can deal with Scizor and faster offensive Pokemon are also a great help to Kyurem. Quagsire fits this role nicely, since it also has good type synergy with Kyurem and can deal with Scizor. Since Kyurem can deal with stall, Pokemon that struggle to break though stall, such as Terrakion, appreciate Kyurem's support. Toxic Spikes from Scolipede can also help with Kyurem's stalling ability immensely since most of Kyurem's switch-ins are grounded.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Substitute allows Kyurem to avoid status and helps it effectively Pressure stall, as it tends to be faster than most, if not all, walls. Roost is for reliable recovery and allows Kyurem to Pressure stall even longer. Ice Beam is a reliable STAB move and hits hard with a Life Orb boost and Special Attack investment. Earth Power has great synergy with Ice Beam, hitting Fire- and Steel-types super effectively while hitting Water-types harder than Ice Beam. Dragon Tail is an option if your team stacks entry hazards, as it phazes and helps rack up chip damage.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The 56 HP EVs give Kyurem 405 HP in total, allowing Kyurem to have 101 HP Substitutes, which is ideal to avoid the Substitute being broken by Seismic Toss and to survive four switches into Stealth Rock. Timid is the ideal nature when combined with 216 Speed EVs, as they allow Kyurem to outspeed positive nature base 90 Speed Pokemon. While Dragon Tail is an option, it isn't going to be a powerful attack, as it is only used for phazing. Life Orb is used to ensure Kyurem hits harder, which works well as Kyurem has reliable recovery in Roost, mitigating the HP loss from making Substitutes and Life Orb recoil. Leftovers is also an option, which allows Kyurem to have more survivability at the cost of power.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This set can be used throughout the game to Pressure stall low PP moves, like Draco Meteor, Stone Edge, and Close Combat. Its move coverage coupled with its decent Special Attack means it can wear the opponent down while stalling out hits that could spell doom. This set must be very wary of Infiltrator users such as Crobat, as Infiltrator can now hit through Substitutes.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Kyurem really loves entry hazards removed, as it is susceptible to all of them, especially Stealth Rock. Mega Blastoise makes a great partner, as it can wallbreak with its Mega Launcher boosted attacks, and its bulk allows it to spin multiple times throughout the match. Florges is an amazing partner, as it takes all the Dragon- and Fighting-type attacks aimed at Kyurem. Although they are both weak to Steel, it isn't that common of an attacking type. Kyurem also loves its own hazard support, as it forces switches with the Pressure stalling. More specifically, Kyurem likes Spikes support, as most common switch-ins are Fighting-types such as Infernape or Mienshao.</p>\n"
