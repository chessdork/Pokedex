     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>The first move, Fake Out, works exceptionally well for racking up chip damage while temporarily halting a threatening opponent or stopping a potential Trick Room user from setting up. Fake Out also gives Mega Kangaskhan's teammate a chance to set up itself, allow its teammates a free turn to put a Pokemon to sleep, or attack the less threatening target while putting frailer threats such as Mega Charizard Y into KO range for Sucker Punch. Return is Mega Kangaskhan's most consistent and drawback-free STAB; however, Double-Edge can be used to snag a few useful KOs. For example, with the combination of Fake Out + Double-Edge and an Adamant nature, Mega Kangaskhan has the chance to OHKO most variants of Togekiss and even Landorus-T through Intimidate. However, Mega Kangaskhan's power is so great that Fake Out and Return is enough to OHKO threats such as 252 / 0 Rotom-W. Sucker Punch is Mega Kangaskhan's main means of revenge killing the opponent, as the move can easily wipe out Latios and a weakened Reuniclus under Trick Room. Power-Up Punch is what allows Mega Kangaskhan to sweep and break past bulkier targets; it boosts her Attack stat to two stages, allowing her to, at worst, 2HKO the entire metagame. Once boosted, Power-Up Punch can also function as a decent coverage move against the likes of Heatran and Tyranitar.</p>\n<p>There are a few alternate moves that Mega Kangaskhan can make use of, such as Crunch, Drain Punch, and Protect. Crunch allows Mega Kangaskhan to bust through Ghost-types without having to lean on the unreliable Sucker Punch. Drain Punch works superbly in tandem with Double-Edge by giving Mega Kangaskhan a decent coverage move for the likes of Heatran and Tyranitar, while simultaneously restoring her health. Lastly, Protect can help keep Mega Kangaskhan from being exposed to her own teammates' spread moves or targeted by the two opposing Pokemon, while allowing her partner to deal with a troublesome check so that she won't constantly be forced to switch out and possibly lose her Attack boosts. If any of these moves sound appealing, they should be used over either Power-Up Punch or Fake Out, though forgoing the previous two options takes away much of the sweeping and utility potential that Mega Kangaskhan possesses.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Scrappy is chosen as the main ability so that Kangaskhan can flinch a Ghost-type with Fake Out should a situation require it, such as to stop Trevenant or Jellicent from setting up Trick Room. When it comes to natures, an Adamant one is generally preferred, as it can achieve the above KOs. Furthermore, Kangaskhan has no shortage of priority moves, so the extra Speed bestowed by a Jolly nature is less necessary. However, it can be useful to get the jump on max Speed base 90s such as Landorus-T and Lucario, outspeed neutral natured base 100s such as Volcarona, have a better chance to oust opposing Fake Out Mega Kangaskhan, and Speed tie with max Speed 100s such as Charizard. As far as alternate EV spreads are concerned, Mega Kangaskhan can relinquish her Speed EVs and instead add them to HP in order to take better advantage of her naturally high bulk, which proves especially handy should Mega Kangaskhan have some form of speed control support.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>It's best to bring Mega Kangaskhan in mid-game, as at that point, the opposing team will be weakened enough for her to smash through with her impressive power, or help her pull off a sweep with greater ease. However, Mega Kangaskhan can also be brought in at the start of the match to provide handy Fake Out support and/or stop the opposing team's Fake Out user. She can also make use of this move by providing her teammates an opportunity to set up themselves. Fake Out can also be used in tandem with Sucker Punch to revenge kill speed demons such as Swift Swim Kingdra or be used alone to stop the likes of Trick Room Aromatisse from setting up. Although Fake Out is obviously the first move to use once Mega Kangaskhan is sent out, it's very much dependent on the given battle conditions whether or not she should straight-up attack or attempt a sweep with Power-Up Punch. It's also good to analyze the situation at hand\u2014whether it's worth going for a sweep or switching Mega Kangaskhan back out to utilize Fake Out again. When against less threatening targets such as Jirachi, Zygarde, or weakened Pokemon such as Abomasnow or Kyurem-B, it's the perfect time to go for Power-Up Punch; however, against slower, bulkier, and more threatening targets such as Conkeldurr or Hitmontop, it's moreso in Mega Kangaskhan's favor to go straight for the kill.</p>\n<p>Do note that Mega Kangaskhan should not be brought in against status-wielding threats (provided that she doesn't have the right support) such as Jellicent or Klefki, as a quick burn or paralysis keeps Mega Kangaskhan from sweeping. Furthermore, it's also advised to take down the opposing team's Intimidate user, as it can continually switch in and out of Mega Kangaskhan and rob her of her Attack boosts. If the opposing team has more than one Intimidate user, then simply taking out one will suffice. Once all these unfriendly conditions are cleared, Mega Kangaskhan can use Power-Up Punch to easily sweep the opposing team and smash right through their bulky supporters.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Volcarona makes a fantastic partner for Mega Kangaskhan, as it can roast the likes of Gourgeist-S, Mega Mawile, and Aegislash with Heat Wave and/or redirect Fighting-type attacks and Will-O-Wisp with Rage Powder. In return, Mega Kangaskhan can provide Fake Out support, allowing Volcarona to launch an attack without fearing a potential Rock Slide user or set up a Quiver Dance with minimal difficulty. Similarly, Talonflame works well with Mega Kangaskhan, as it can destroy Fighting-types with Brave Bird and demolish Steel-types with Flare Blitz. Talonflame can also clean up after Mega Kangaskhan finishes pulverizing the opposing team. Mega Kangaskhan can aid Talonflame by dealing with the likes of Rotom-W and bulkier threats such as Cresselia. Another good Fire-type to pair Mega Kangaskhan with is Chandelure, given that it easily beats many of her checks with its Ghost / Fire typing, which gives it fantastic dual STABs.</p>\n<p>More support-oriented partners include Togekiss and Amoonguss. Togekiss and Amoonguss can both redirect crippling status moves and Fighting-type attacks with Follow Me and Rage Powder respectively. Moreover, Togekiss can make itself more useful by dealing with the likes of Gourgeist-S and providing speed control support with either Thunder Wave or Tailwind. Amoonguss can also provide Spore support, which allows Mega Kangaskhan to take the time to use Power-Up Punch without having to worry about being crippled by a powerful attack. Furthermore, Amoonguss can also use Giga Drain to dent Terrakion and Jellicent. Cresselia and Klefki can also support Mega Kangaskhan in other ways. Both of these Pokemon can easily set up dual screens, which skyrockets Mega Kangaskhan's already impressive defenses. For instance, with Reflect activated, Mega Kangaskhan survives even a Life Orb-boosted Close Combat from Terrakion. This is useful as it allows her to make better use of Power-Up Punch, and in Cresselia's case, it can also provide Helping Hand support to give her attacks an even bigger kick. On the other hand, Klefki can make use of its priority Thunder Wave to easily cripple fast Fighting-types and other troublesome threats. Klefki can also utilize Prankster Swagger and Safeguard to give Mega Kangaskhan a free +2 Attack boost without the added confusion. Similarly, Latias can provide speed control support in the form of Thunder Wave or Tailwind, heal Mega Kangaskhan's HP by 50% with Heal Pulse, and boost her power with Helping Hand.</p>\n<p>Hitmontop and Scrafty excel at providing some unique offensive support. Both of these Pokemon sport Intimidate, which makes Mega Kangaskhan very difficult to take down and gives her more setup opportunities. Both of these Pokemon can also provide Fake Out support, which also helps Mega Kangaskhan to set up more easily. Unlike Hitmontop, Scrafty can deal with Ghost-types with its STAB Crunch; however, Hitmontop's neutrality to Fighting-type moves allows it to deal with Mega Lucario more easily. Speaking of Ghost-types, two other Pokemon that deal with them are Bisharp and Aegislash. Bisharp's STAB Knock Off can OHKO almost every Ghost-type. Bisharp can even help Mega Kangaskhan deal with faster threats with its own Sucker Punch and discourage repeated use of Intimidate thanks to Defiant. Aegislash can also take on Ghost-types, but it has the added benefit of being able to counter almost every Fighting-type as well. Aegislash also provides Wide Guard support to shield the two from Heat Waves and Earthquakes. Mega Kangaskhan can return the favor by using Fake Out to provide the chance for Substitute variants to set up.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Even if it's resisted, Return is your go-to move for dealing damage, capping out at 102 Base Power and working off Mega Kangaskhan's base Attack of 125, further boosted by Parental Bond. Fake Out gives Kangaskhan great utility and can help you set up or KO with your partner, as well as dealing heavy chip damage to help Return nab KOs. However, if you already have Fake Out support or feel Mega Kangaskhan should be more concerned with itself than with its teammates, Protect can be used in Fake Out's place to give Kangaskhan more longevity and, more importantly, make Kangaskhan less prone to double-targeting. Sucker Punch is mainly for priority, but is occasionally good for hitting Ghost-types when they decide to attack. Power-Up Punch makes Kangaskhan a deadly force to be reckoned with, allowing Return to 2HKO Pokemon that resist it, such as Mega Mawile. It also helps Kangaskhan recover from a burn it might have suffered or multiple Intimidate Attack drops, as well as dealing chip damage for it and its partners.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Scrappy is generally the more useful ability for regular Kangaskhan, allowing it to Fake Out Ghost-types such as Chandelure and Aeigislash or even Power-Up Punch them for a boost. However, Inner Focus can be useful to help a partner set up Tailwind or other such moves in the event that you need to get off a Fake Out (for instance, Talonflame might have to set up Tailwind against Tyranitar while Kangaskhan gets Faked Out by a faster user).</p>\n<p>Either Jolly or Adamant natures will work for Kangaskhan. As Mega Kangaskhan sits at base 100 Speed along with other threats such as Charizard and Salamence, it's usually best to go with a Jolly nature to get the jump on Modest Charizard and Salamence and at worst Speed tie with Timid ones. If you value consistent power over Speed ties, Adamant is the superior option.</p>\n<p>A bulkier EV spread is worth considering, but is usually unneeded. Thanks to Kangaskhan's natural bulk, a mere 4 HP EVs will allow Kangaskhan to survive the vast majority of common moves such as Salamence's Draco Meteor and Rotom-H's Overheat at full health. Another reason to consider a bulkier EV spread, however, is to underspeed other base 100 Speed Pokemon for use alongside Trick Room, or to make Kangaskhan more resilient when used alongside Tailwind.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>If it isn't obvious by now, unless you're making use of Scrappy or Inner Focus, you should make a point to Mega Evolve as soon as possible. From there, use Return often and keep Kangaskhan from being burned by switching out, which also resets Fake Out, allowing you to apply pressure later in the match.</p>\n<p>You should be careful not to get greedy with Power-Up Punch boosts, especially when Kangaskhan isn't actively being supported with teammates threatening KOs or more simple support options such as Follow Me/Rage Powder. One use of Power-Up Punch at +0 will more than likely be all you need to power through opponents with Return and Sucker Punch, aside from Pokemon that resist Return, which are usually 2HKOed. Using Power-Up Punch often is not a bad idea when Kangaskhan is burned or has been Intimidated, however.</p>\n<p>When using Protect, try to bluff having Fake Out by using Return on the first turn and switching out soon after to seem like you're trying to reset Fake Out. Since most Kangaskhan don't Protect and are usually double-targeted because of this, Protect is best used as a surprise move late-game. Additionally, make a point to put yourself into a position where you can KO or incapacitate at least one Pokemon with your partner when Protecting for the best results.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>The best ways to support Kangaskhan are to give it Pokemon that can easily switch with Kangaskhan and redirect and/or prevent Kangaskhan from being double-targeted. Amoonguss does all of the above, as it doesn't particularly mind being burned, can use Rage Powder and Spore, and does a good job of taking Fighting-type attacks. In the same sense, Salamence makes a good switch-in, softening later attacks with Intimidate and doing a good job of eliminating Steel-types with Fire Blast.</p>\n<p>Chandelure, Talonflame, and Rotom-H can OHKO Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Mawile and often do a good job of checking Ghost-types as the more popular ones have a secondary type that's weak to Fire. Talonflame gets a specific mention for its ability to use Tailwind, allowing Kangaskhan to outspeed problematic Pokemon such as Kingdra in the rain and Mega Manectric, as well as its ability to straight-up OHKO Fighting-types with Brave Bird. Other offensive Pokemon such as Gardevoir, Tyranitar, and the previously mentioned Salamence appreciate Kangaskhan's Fake Out and form a hyper-offensive lead and/or core to immediately apply pressure on the opponent and punish slower teams.</p>\n<p>Other Pokemon that take on pure supportive roles that work well with Kangaskhan include Klefki, Meowstic-Male, and Smeargle. Klefki and Meowstic-M can prevent burns altogether with Safeguard and follow it up with Swagger for free Attack boosts or use Reflect and Light Screen to make Mega Kangaskhan even more formidable. Smeargle is viable once again in VGC14 thanks to Dark Void being unbanned. Kangaskhan can Fake Out a Pokemon to allow Smeargle to fire it off, allowing Kangaskhan to comfortably use Power-Up Punch next turn. Something to watch out for when using Smeargle + Kangaskhan however are the Lum or Chesto Berries that are commonly used to check Dark Void. Another thing to keep in mind when using each of these pure supportive Pokemon is Taunt, which can completely shut down your setups.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Fake Out allows Kangaskhan to revenge kill weakened foes and gives it a free turn to Mega Evolve so it can boost its base Speed to 100. Return is a mandatory STAB move and hits a large portion of the metagame very hard. Sucker Punch used in conjunction with Fake Out can pick off many weakened foes and lets Kangaskhan serve as a revenge killer. Earthquake is a viable option to hit Ferrothorn and avoid Iron Barbs damage while also hitting many other Steel-types such as Klefki, Heatran, and Mega Scizor. Crunch is also a good option as it is more reliable than Sucker Punch and hits Giratina, but it is very redundant with Sucker Punch. Power-Up Punch is usable, as it destroys defensively oriented teams, but Kangaskhan prefers coverage options instead. Finally, Low Kick is a great coverage move that usually strikes for 120 Base Power thanks to most Pokemon in the metagame being heavy.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The EV spread is simple, maximizing Kangaskhan's power and Speed. 4 Defense EVs ensure that Genesect does not receive an Attack boost from Download. Jolly is the nature of choice for Mega Kangaskhan to outspeed any Pokemon in the base 90 to base 99 Speed tier while also Speed tying with other base 100 Speed Pokemon such as Palkia. Jolly also lets Kangaskhan outspeed and hit Xerneas before it uses Geomancy. Scrappy is the ability of choice before Mega Evolving, as Kangaskhan can then hit Ghost-types on a predicted switch. An Adamant nature increases Kangaskhan's damage output significantly, but it really needs to outspeed everything below base 100 Speed.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Fake Out gives Kangaskhan space to Mega Evolve while also acting as great chip damage to ease OHKOs with Return. This set is supposed to punch holes and act as a revenge killer with Fake Out, while also having the natural bulk to take some hits if necessary. Be wary when using Sucker Punch as it is a bit of a shaky move; for example, Mega Kangaskhan could try to Sucker Punch a Mega Mewtwo Y only to be hit by a Will-O-Wisp, so always scout beforehand if a Pokemon has any surprise status moves. Mega Kangaskhan does not like switching into many attacks because of its lack of resistances, so double switching is advised. Fake Out can potentially give an opponent a free switch with proper prediction, so don't hesitate to use Return if you think they will switch. Never keep Kangaskhan in on anything that could potentially carry Will-O-Wisp, as this will cripple it. Scout for Rocky Helmet Pokemon such as Yveltal; Kangaskhan takes double Rocky Helmet damage because of Parental Bond. Also be wary of Rough Skin and Iron Barbs.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Yveltal is a great partner as it can handle Lugia and Ghost-types that trouble Mega Kangaskhan. Landorus-T and Groudon beat most Steel-types for Mega Kangaskhan if it lacks Crunch, and Landorus-T in particular can handle Fighting-types that Kangaskhan is weak to. Specially defensive Kyogre can beat most support Arceus, making it a good partner, and it can also absorb burns for Kangaskhan. Deoxys-A and Kangaskhan form a neat core that can be hard to handle with their insane offensive prowess. Cleric support is necessary; some Pokemon that provide cleric support are Xerneas and Sylveon, both of which handle Fighting-types quite nicely as well. Finally, offensive Kyogre and Shaymin-S both beat Arceus-Rock, a Pokemon that can cause issues for Mega Kangaskhan.</p>\n"
