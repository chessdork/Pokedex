     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Thunderbolt is Raikou's reliable STAB; it has the highest damage output and poses a great threat to Water-types and Mega Charizard Y, which Raikou is generally supposed to check. Volt Switch gives it a safe move to pivot and wear down defensive threats with, which works especially well in conjunction with entry hazards. Hidden Power Ice is compulsory coverage to hit Landorus, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Garchomp, which otherwise completely wall Raikou. The last slot boils down to whether 2HKOing Latios (Shadow Ball) or actually threatening Mega Venusaur (Extrasensory) is preferred.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The EVs provide enough Speed to outrun Thundurus and give Raikou a good enough damage output, with the rest in Special Defense to get a bit more special bulk out of the Assault Vest. Maximum Speed can be run to tie with Starmie, but it isn't common enough to be worth sacrificing bulk that comes in handy against threats such as Greninja.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Be wary of switching in and out a lot with this Raikou, as it will be worn down quickly. When in doubt, unless the opponent has a bulky Ground-type to switch in, Volt Switching out is the best option unless you absolutely have to stay in and attack. This keeps the momentum of the battle in your favor. If the opponent has a bulky Ground-type to switch in, just hard switch out anticipating the play.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Pokemon such as Skarmory and Mandibuzz that can handle Ground-types and physical attackers in general are useful teammates. Entry hazards limit this Raikou's longevity immensely due to its lack of Leftovers, so Defog or Rapid Spin support is heavily appreciated. It fits well into VoltTurn cores with Pokemon such as Scizor and Landorus-T.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Calm Mind boosts Raikou's Special Attack, allowing it to function as an effective boosting sweeper. Thunderbolt is the main STAB attack, providing the most power against neutral targets. Hidden Power Ice covers most Ground- and Dragon-types, which would otherwise wall Raikou. Extrasensory gives important coverage to hit Mega Venusaur and Assault Vest Conkeldurr. If Raikou's teammates can handle Mega Venusaur adequately, then Substitute is an option to protect it from status and revenge killers. Volt Switch is another option, allowing Raikou to pivot around and have general use throughout the match; however, it is prone to being worn down and thus might have trouble sweeping, and it becomes hard to justify this over an Assault Vest or Choice Specs variant.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The Special Attack and Speed EVs enable Raikou to outrun Thundurus whilst hitting as hard as possible. The rest is dumped into HP for a small amount of extra bulk. Leftovers is useful to keep Raikou healthy so it can stay healthy whilst setting up and completing its sweep. Life Orb is also an option for some more power; for example, +1 Life Orb-boosted Extrasensory does roughly 80% to Mega Venusaur.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This Raikou can set up on Thundurus, one of the largest threats in OU, so setting up shouldn't be too difficult. Naturally, don't set up until Raikou's counters have been removed; until it can sweep, switching in at all should generally be avoided. Furthermore, don't be too greedy with boosts and let Raikou get worn down into a range where it can be revenge killed by priority.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Pokemon to take out pesky Excadrill, Hippowdon, Mamoswine, and Choice Scarf Garchomp are heavily appreciated. Offensive Water-types, such as Keldeo, Manaphy, and Greninja, are standout options. Eliminating Chansey is also necessary; the aforementioned Keldeo as well as lures such as Knock Off Landorus fit this role nicely. If Substitute is chosen, then Pokemon to take out Mega Venusaur are mandatory; Landorus and Mega Charizard X are both adept at this task.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>With a blistering Speed stat, Raikou makes an effective revenge killer with Choice Scarf equipped. Thunderbolt is Raikou's STAB attack, with high Base Power and no drawbacks. Hidden Power Ice creates the pseudo-BoltBeam combination and hits almost everything for at least neutral damage. Volt Switch allows Raikou to gain momentum for the team as well as allowing it to escape dangerous threats. The last move is a bit of a toss-up. Extrasensory is the preferred move, as it allow Raikou to hit the many Poison- and Fighting-types that fill the tier. Aura Sphere can be used to hit many problematic Pokemon such as Snorlax and Umbreon for super effective damage, however it forces Raikou to run a Rash nature, which means it barely outspeeds base 100 Pokemon.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Due to Raikou's fantastic Speed, it makes a great revenge killer, outpacing the majority of the tier with Choice Scarf equipped. The EV spread allows Raikou to hit as fast and hard as possible. A Timid nature is used to allow Raikou to outpace as many Pokemon as possible.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>As Raikou will be locked into one move due to Choice Scarf, try your best to predict well. Raikou will force out many switches, so take advantage of that and use Volt Switch to keep momentum; be aware of Ground-types that will try to switch in to absorb it, if you predict that happening, use the right move or switch out.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Entry hazard support is almost mandatory, as it allows Raikou to revenge kill more efficiently. Swampert, Smeargle, Qwilfish, and Roserade make good partners. Raikou gets worn down easily as it will be using Volt Switch often, so Rapid Spin or Defog support is greatly appreciated. Blastoise makes a great offensive partner, taking on Ground-type Pokemon that trouble Raikou with ease. Wish support is valuable, as Raikou has no reliable recovery or any way to cure status. Florges and Umbreon make excellent Wish passers, and they both have access to Aromatherapy and Heal Bell respectively. Jirachi makes a good partner as well as it can Wish pass, though it shares the same Ground-type weakness with Raikou. Grass-types such as Roserade and Shaymin are great partners because they can take care of Swampert and Gastrodon, two Pokemon that greatly trouble Raikou, as well as having great type synergy with Raikou. In addition, Rotom-H is a great partner as it can switch into Ground-type moves thanks to its Levitate ability and burn the opposing Pokemon, cushioning the next incoming physical attack.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Thunderbolt is the obligatory STAB attack and deals a massive amount of damage to anything that does not resist it. Hidden Power Grass is the preferred Hidden Power, nailing most of Raikou's hard counters such as Rhyperior, Gastrodon, and Swampert. On the other hand, Hidden Power Ice creates a pseudo-BoltBeam combination and hits almost everything for at least neutral damage. Volt Switch allows Raikou to provide valuable momentum for the team as well as allowing Raikou to escape from potential threats. Finally, Extrasensory hits Poison-types such as Roserade, Nidoking, and Nidoqueen harder than Hidden Power Ice as well as providing coverage to hit Fighting-type Pokemon for super effective damage.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>It's easy to see why one would equip Choice Specs on a Pokemon like Raikou. It raises Raikou's already high Special Attack to extreme levels. Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment allows Raikou to hit as hard and fast as possible. A Timid nature gives Raikou the ability to outpace most unboosted Pokemon in the tier.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Do your best to predict well, as Raikou will be locked into one move due to Choice Specs. As Raikou causes so many switches due to its sheer power, using Volt Switch is a good idea to scout the opponent and gain momentum for your team. However, be cautious of opposing Ground-types, as using Volt Switch as one switches in will hurt your team's momentum.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Because Raikou attracts Ground-type moves, Grass-types make great partners with Raikou. They take on the Ground-types that trouble Raikou, and in return Raikou takes the Flying-type moves aimed at them. In addition, Rotom-H is a great partner and is immune to Ground-type moves thanks to its Levitate ability, and can burn Pokemon to cushion physical attacks for Raikou. Raikou will be using Volt Switch a lot, so Defog or Rapid Spin support is appreciated. In addition, cleric support is greatly appreciated as Raikou has no other means of recovery; Umbreon and Florges are good choices. Entry hazard support is recommended as it allows Raikou to secure certain KOs, such as on specially defensive Celebi after Stealth Rock and three layers of Spikes, as well as having the capability of sweeping more easily.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Thunderbolt provides a strong, reliable STAB option. Volt Switch is decently powerful with a Choice Specs boost and moreover provides Raikou with a cost-free move that lets it pivot out of unfavorable matchups. Hidden Power Ice hits crucial Ground- and Dragon-types for super effective damage, especially Landorus, Landorus-T, Garchomp, Gliscor, and any Hippowdon without more than the standard 140 Special Defense EVs. Shadow Ball is good for a heavier hit on Latios, taking off upwards of three-quarters of its HP, and it also takes away almost half of Excadrill's health, changing it from a safe switch-in into something that can only switch in once. Extrasensory covers Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss, which can otherwise handle this set well.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The Special Attack and Speed EVs enable Raikou to outrun Thundurus whilst hitting as hard as possible. The rest is dumped into HP for a bit of extra bulk.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Volt Switch is generally the spam move of choice, dealing moderate damage and providing a safeguard against poor matchups. Against Ground-type foes, it's typically best to hard switch into a better matchup on the predicted switch so that you don't lose momentum. Thunderbolt should be used to clean and for extra power if it is needed to obtain a KO. Like all Raikou variants, you'll want to be careful switching it in, as Raikou is prone to being worn down by entry hazards and even resisted attacks. If the foe has a Pokemon such as Thundurus, Mega Pinsir, or Talonflame, you'll want to make sure Raikou isn't brought down to such a range where they can break through it.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>This Raikou finds itself at home on offensive teams with VoltTurn cores. Pokemon such as Mega Scizor can form such cores; Mega Scizor specifically can pressure Chansey with Knock Off and generally threaten it, which is necessary for Raikou to break through defensive teams. Defog or spin support is essential to keep it in tip-top shape to handle threats; Skarmory and Mandibuzz can handle threatening Ground-types well and fill this role. Kyurem-B, Keldeo, and Manaphy are options to take care of Ground-types, too.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Thunderbolt is Raikou's STAB attack and has high Base Power and no drawbacks. The Hidden Power type is a bit of a toss-up. Hidden Power Grass is preferred, hitting Gastrodon, Rhyperior, and Swampert hard. However, Hidden Power Ice creates a psuedo-BoltBeam combination, nailing problematic Pokemon such as Flygon and Gligar. Extrasensory hits the Fighting- and Poison-types that fill the tier for super effective damage. Calm Mind is used to allow Raikou to sweep more easily.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Life Orb gives Raikou an offensive boost and gives it the option to hit hard without being locked into a move at the cost of losing some HP. The EV spread allows Raikou to hit as hard and fast as possible. A Timid nature is used to further increase Raikou's Speed and allows it outrun most unboosted Pokemon in the metagame.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Raikou forces many switches due to its sheer power. Taking advantage of the switches and using the time to set up Calm Mind is a good idea. Try not to get Raikou inflicted with status because it ruins Raikou's chances of a successful sweep.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Cleric support is very useful, as Raikou will be worn down easily by Life Orb recoil and is prone to status. Wish support is greatly appreciated as Raikou has no form of reliable recovery. Pokemon such as Umbreon and Florges make great partners as they have access to both Wish and status-curing moves. In addition, Rapid Spin and Defog support is greatly appreciated because Raikou will be taking a lot of damage from switching into entry hazards and Life Orb damage will make Raikou go down fast. Likewise, entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Smeargle is almost mandatory, as it is vital for Raikou to secure KOs on Pokemon such as specially defensive Jirachi after three layers of Spikes. Pokemon that can deal with Ground-types make good partners, such as Water- and Grass-type Pokemon. These include Pokemon such as Vaporeon and Roserade as they can take care of the Pokemon such as Swampert and Rhyperior that trouble Raikou. Rotom-H is a great partner as it can switch into Ground-type moves thanks to its Levitate ability.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Thunderbolt is Raikou's main STAB attack, hitting Pokemon such as Talonflame, Mega Charizard Y, and Politoed hard. Hidden Power Ice forms a pseudo-BoltBeam combination with Thunderbolt, hitting Pokemon such as Garchomp that can take a Thunderbolt. Snarl is a great move for weakening the attacks of common special attackers, allowing Raikou to more easily take special hits. Protect is great in the last spot for avoiding spread moves such as Earthquake, punishing double targeting, stalling field conditions, and scouting. If Assault Vest is used, Volt Switch should be used in the last spot to help switch out of unfavorable situations while also getting off chip damage and gaining momentum.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The EV spread with a Timid nature is used for as much power as possible, ensuring that Raikou will outspeed Pokemon such as Mega Lucario and Thundurus. Shuca Berry is the preferred item, as it allows Raikou to comfortably take an Earthquake and attack. It also allows Raikou to lure Garchomp and Choice Scarf Landorus-T and hit them with Hidden Power Ice, as well as safely switch into the latter. Assault Vest can also be used, as it gives Raikou even more special bulk. It does mean that Raikou can't use Protect, however, leaving it susceptible to Earthquake. Life Orb, while not on the set, can be used to guarantee certain OHKOs, such as Hidden Power Ice OHKOing non-Yache Berry Garchomp, Thunderbolt OHKOing Mega Charizard Y, and Hidden Power Ice OHKOing Landorus-T. It does, however, cut into Raikou's health and make it take Life Orb recoil every time it uses Snarl.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Raikou is best brought in on Flying- and Electric-types such as Togekiss and Thundurus, as it can wall these Pokemon with relative ease. Snarl should be used often if your opponent has special attackers out, as it can cripple them and make it easier for your teammates to attack or set up. Be careful of Defiant users such as Bisharp, however, as they will receive a +2 Attack boost from Snarl. Residual damage can rack up quickly due to Raikou's lack of reliable recovery, so try to keep Raikou as healthy as possible during the match. If Assault Vest is being used, you need to know when to Volt Switch and when to switch out directly. You also must be wary of Earthquake, as you can no longer use Protect to block it.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Pokemon such as Shaymin-S and Breloom appreciate Raikou's ability to threaten Flying-types. Pokemon such as Talonflame and Gyarados appreciate Raikou's ability to wall Electric-types and lower their Special Attack with Snarl. Wide Guard support from Hitmontop or Aegislash is helpful, especially if Raikou is holding an Assault Vest, as it allows Raikou to avoid Earthquake. Mega Evolutions are usually partnered with Raikou, as Mega Manectric is a better option for a fast, offensive Electric-type otherwise. Mega Kangaskhan can provide Fake Out support, while Mega Charizard Y likes Raikou's ability to deal with Electric-type Pokemon such as Thundurus. Pokemon such as Conkeldurr and Rotom-W can deal with the Ground-types such as Mamoswine and Excadrill that threaten Raikou, making them very helpful partners. Intimidate and Will-O-Wisp support from the likes of Hitmontop, Scrafty, Mega Gengar, and Talonflame helps Raikou take physical attacks much easier.</p>\n"

Flygon, Starmie, and Crobat make good partners. Flygon, especially, has great type synergy with Raikou. Pokemon that are resistant or immune to Ground-type moves are also good partners. Rotom-H is a fantastic partner for Raikou because it is immune to Ground-type moves courtesy of its Levitate ability. It can also burn Pokemon to cushion physical attacks for Raikou as well as damage them with Hidden Power Grass. In addition, Grass-types such as Shaymin make excellent partners because they can get rid of problematic Pokemon like Gastrodon and Swampert that would otherwise stop Raikou right in its tracks. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Roserade, Smeargle, and Gligar is vital for allowing Raikou to secure KOs that it wouldn't normally get.</p>\n"
