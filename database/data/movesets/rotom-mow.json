     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Leaf Storm is a strong STAB move that severely hurts everything weak to it, especially Pokemon like Rhyperior and Gastrodon, while also being able to damage many Pokemon that aren't weak to it. Volt Switch is this set's main move, as it allows Rotom-C to gain momentum, while still hitting hard thanks to it being a STAB move. Thunderbolt is the secondary STAB move and lets Rotom-C clean late-game thanks to its reliability. Finally, Trick can cripple some common switch-ins to Rotom-C, such as Registeel and Amoonguss, for the rest of the match. Will-O-Wisp can be used along with Trick to effectively spread burns after tricking the Choice Scarf away, but isn't preferred because it removes Rotom-C's ability to clean late-game with Thunderbolt, the only reliable STAB move Rotom-C has.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Maximum Speed along with maximum Special Attack allows Rotom-C to be as fast as possible to outspeed slower threats such as Gallade, Braviary, and Tyrantrum, while also hitting as hard as possible. The choice between Timid and Modest comes down to whether you want it to hit harder or outspeed positive-natured Choice Scarf base 80 Pokemon such as Braviary and Adamant Hitmonlee. Choice Scarf allows Rotom-C to act as a late-game cleaner that can revenge kill threats such as Hitmonlee, Moltres, Delphox, Cobalion, and Durant, among others.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This particular set allows Rotom-C to act as a late-game cleaner and revenge killer that can be used early-game to grab momentum with Volt Switch. If the opponent's team lacks a Ground-type or a Pokemon that is immune to Electric-type moves such as Jolteon, then feel free to use Volt Switch early-game as much as possible to gain momentum. If a Pokemon that is immune to Electric-type moves is on the opponent's team, then use it carefully, and some prediction with Leaf Storm must be done. Leaf Storm's Special Attack drop can also cause Rotom-C to be setup fodder for Pokemon such as Braviary, Gallade, Delphox, and Moltres, so use it sparingly. Using Trick against some common switch-ins such as Amoonguss and Registeel will cripple them for the rest of the match, but think twice before using Trick against an offensive team, as it can backfire if you give the wrong Pokemon a Choice Scarf.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Wallbreakers generally work well with Rotom-C because of their ability to weaken teams so that Rotom-C can easily clean up late-game. For that reason, offensive Druddigon, Delphox, Exploud, Escavalier, and Moltres are good teammates. Additionally, Pokemon with Volt Switch or U-turn make good teammates because they create a VoltTurn core along with Rotom-C. Braviary, Swellow, Moltres, and Jolteon are good options, especially the former three, because they can lure Rhyperior and Alomomola for Rotom-C to easily get rid of.</p>\n<p>Fire-types, specifically Moltres, make good partners for Rotom-C because of their ability to easily KO Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Registeel, all of which Rotom-C has trouble against. Entry hazard support is also something it appreciates, and Pokemon such as Druddigon, Rhyperior, and Cobalion can provide Stealth Rock while Accelgor and Qwilfish provide Spikes.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Volt Switch is a necessity for letting Rotom-C switch to a Pokemon that matches up favorably against the one your opponent has out, keeping momentum. Leaf Storm is a powerful STAB attack that dents many Pokemon that don't resist it, and it makes short work of Ground-types who try to come in on a predicted Volt Switch. Thunderbolt is a STAB move that can be used if you wish to stay in and hit harder than Volt Switch, but it can be foregone in order to run a utility option such as Pain Split or Will-O-Wisp. Trick lets Rotom-C burden a specially defensive wall with a Choice Scarf upon their switch-in.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>With a Choice Scarf equipped, Rotom-C becomes a potent revenge killer. Full investment in Special Attack and Speed lets Rotom-C hit as hard and fast as possible. The 4 EVs in Special Defense let Porygon2 and Porygon-Z end up with a Download boost to their Attack stat. A Timid nature lets Rotom-C have the best chance of getting in an attack first, though it can use a Modest nature to crank up its damage output.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>As it takes on the role of a revenge killer with this set, Rotom-C should be brought into play after one of its teammates has been taken out. Volt Switch will be the move you will be using most in order to continually grab that vital offensive momentum and either revenge kill or wear down the opponent. Use Trick when you predict a switch to the likes of Porygon2, Snorlax, and other specially defensive Pokemon. If you predict a switch to a Ground-type, use Leaf Storm instead of Volt Switch.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>As Stealth Rock wears Rotom-C down as it repeatedly switches in, Rapid Spin or Defog support is useful. Blastoise in particular makes for a good partner, as it can spin away Stealth Rock and check Fire-types such as Darmanitan that try to ruin Rotom-C's fun. As this set is centered around the gain of momentum with Volt Switch, it can be played in a VoltTurn team to great success. Rotom-C appreciates teammates such as Darmanitan that can threaten problematic Grass-types. Assuming it hasn't boosted its Defense, Snorlax, which walls Rotom-C, is easily handled by physical Fighting-types such as Mienshao, Infernape, and Machamp.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Leaf Storm is the strongest move Rotom-C has access to and allows it to act as a wallbreaker with Choice Specs, hitting anything that doesn't resist it ridiculously hard at the cost of lowering Rotom-C's Special Attack by two stages. Volt Switch is a STAB move that hits decently hard while also increasing momentum, and Thunderbolt is used as a reliable STAB attack without any drawbacks. Trick is to cripple common switch-ins such as Amoonguss, Registeel, and Tangrowth and make them useless for the rest of the match. Hidden Power Fire can be used to hit Pokemon like Amoonguss, Virizion, Tangrowth, Registeel, and Escavalier harder, while Hidden Power Ice can be used to hit Druddigon and Gligar for super effective damage.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>The EVs allow Rotom-C to outspeed neutral-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon such as Braviary and Kabutops, while also providing maximum Special Attack with the rest dumped in HP for better bulk and an easier time switching into Pokemon its supposed to check. The choice between Modest and Timid comes down to whether power or Speed is more important, as Modest lets Rotom-C break walls more easily and do more damage in general, while Timid allows it to outspeed positive-natured base 80 Speed Pokemon such as Gallade and Braviary. Choice Specs allows Rotom-C to act as a wallbreaker with Leaf Storm and Thunderbolt and gain momentum while doing damage with Volt Switch. Expert Belt can be used, especially because Rotom-C enforces a lot of mindgames when facing Ground-types such as Rhyperior or Gastrodon, and can sometimes lure them into expecting a Volt Switch or a Thunderbolt and hit them afterwards with a Leaf Storm. In this case, it can also bluff a Choice item effectively, if it does not give away the facade by switching moves. Expert Belt is an especially good choice if Rotom-C is using Hidden Power along with hazards support.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Rotom-C is better sent out early-game to use Volt Switch and gain momentum, especially if the opponent's team lacks an Electric-type immunity such as a Ground-type or Jolteon. If that's the case, then prediction is necessary, and using Leaf Storm in the right moment can be crucial to hurt the Electric-type immunities on the switch, but be careful of the Special Attack drop, as it can make Rotom-C setup fodder for Pokemon such as Braviary, Gallade, and Delphox. Unlike the Choice Scarf set, this set aims to be more of a wallbreaker rather than a sweeper, so using it early- and mid-game to weaken teams for other sweepers to clean up is ideal.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Strong Fire-types such as Delphox and Moltres can form an effective offensive core with Rotom-C because they beat Grass-types easily, while Rotom-C beats bulky Water-types for them. Moltres, in particular, is a good teammate because it also has access to U-turn and can form a VoltTurn core. Fletchinder can beat Grass-types as well, and it also has priority Acrobatics that can sweep weakened teams late-game. Entry hazards work well with Rotom-C, making Druddigon, Cobalion, and Rhyperior good options to set up Stealth Rock while Accelgor and Qwilfish can set up Spikes, with the latter being able to set up Toxic Spikes as well. As this particular set likes to switch into bulky Water-types and Rhyperior, using it alongside a cleric such as Aromatisse for Wish support and status recovery is useful; Alomomola can also switch into Fire-type moves aimed at Rotom-C while also providing useful Wish support.</p>\n<p>Choice Specs Rotom-C plays as a wallbreaker first and foremost, and for this reason, pairing it up with sweepers and late-game cleaners is ideal. Pokemon like Swellow and Choice Scarf Braviary can be good teammates, because they have access to U-turn and can lure in Rhyperior early-game for Rotom-C to kill, and they form a VoltTurn core with Rotom-C which helps gain momentum early-game. In general, Choice Scarf users are good for their ability to clean up and sweep late-game and for that reason, Pokemon like Delphox and Emboar work well. Pokemon such as Sharpedo and Jolteon can also clean up late-game and sweep.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Volt Switch is your go-to for momentum-grabbing, and with Choice Specs equipped, it's going to pack an extra punch. Leaf Storm is an already powerful attack, and not much can stand up to the sheer power it sports after a boost from Choice Specs. Thunderbolt's a viable option if you wish to have a harder-hitting Electric-type STAB move and don't want to switch out, though it is by no means mandatory and can be eschewed in favor of a utility option such as Pain Split or Will-O-Wisp. Trick can cripple special walls that attempt to come in and take Rotom-C's attacks; for example, Pokemon like Umbreon and Snorlax will lose a lot of utility with Choice Specs forced upon them.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Choice Specs turns Rotom-C into a hard-hitting offensive pivot that is capable of OHKOing lots of UU's frailer threats. Full investment in Special Attack and Speed lets Rotom-C hit as hard and as fast as possible. 4 EVs in Special Defense give Download users a boost to their Attack. A Timid nature is optimal for this set, as Rotom-C needs to be as fast as possible.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>This set's focus is wallbreaking, and it should be played as such. Trick away your Choice Specs if you predict a special wall to come in. Leaf Storm is the primary choice of attack on account of its spectucular power, even when resisted. The drop in Special Attack isn't the biggest of concerns, given the hit and run nature of this set. Take advantage of Rotom-C's resistances to common attacking types when searching for an opportunity to switch it in.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Choice Specs variants of Rotom-C fit well on offensively-inclined teams. As it is effective at removing certain troublesome defensive threats such as Suicune and Gligar, Rotom-C works well with Pokemon like Darmanitan, which despise the aforementioned defensive Pokemon. In particular, the latter can threaten the Grass-types that can sponge Rotom-C's STAB attacks, and it can also use U-turn to provide its own momentum. Removal of Stealth Rock enables Rotom-C to go about using Volt Switch without having to worry about being slowly worn down, so Rapid Spin or Defog support is always appreciated. Examples of teammates capable of providing this are Mega Blastoise, Tentacruel, Starmie, and Crobat. As Rotom-C is walled by Snorlax, physically offensive Fighting-types make for good teammates, as they are great checks to the latter if it hasn't boosted its Defense. Mienshao, Infernape, and Machamp are examples of such Pokemon.</p>\n"

     "description": "<h4>Moves</h4>\n<p>Leaf Storm is a solid STAB move that will do some decent damage, even when uninvested. Volt Switch lets Rotom-C switch out to an appropriate teammate whilst doing a bit of damage. Pain Split works well in conjunction with Rotom-C's poor HP and is its best means of recovery. In the last slot, Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers and also deals residual damage, whereas Thunder Wave significantly slows fast threats.</p>\n<h4>Set Details</h4>\n<p>Maximized HP and Special Defense EVs in combination with a Calm nature ensure that Rotom-C can take special hits the absolute best it can. Leftovers provides all-important passive healing.</p>\n<h4>Usage Tips</h4>\n<p>Thanks to its typing, Rotom-C can make for a solid switch-in to opponents such as Mega Blastoise. Volt Switch should be used to seize offensive momentum. Rotom-C should aim to spread status around the team of the opponent as you see fit. Pain Split is best used when Rotom-C's health is dwindling and its opponent's health is relatively high. Leaf Storm should be used when Rotom-C needs to do some more significant damage. Be wary that due to Leaf Storm's detrimental side effect, you will probably want to hard switch or Volt Switch out after using it. Rotom-C sports resistances to several common attacking types, so bring it into play on a predicted use of a move such as Thunderbolt or Hydro Pump.</p>\n<h4>Team Options</h4>\n<p>Like the Choice Scarf set, this set values Rapid Spin or Defog support to stop Rotom-C from being plagued by residual damage. Offensively-inclined Pokemon who benefit from the offensive momentum gained and struggle against the bulky Water-types that Rotom-C can deal with make for good teammates. Darmanitan is such a Pokemon, and not only is it also able to use U-turn to provide the team with its own momentum, but it can dispatch of the Grass-types like Roserade that Rotom-C struggles against.</p>\n"
